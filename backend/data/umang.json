HOW IT IS IMPORTANT?\nThe User Interface (UI) refers to a product/service's visual and interactive\n                                    elements, that\n                                    are\n                                    used by the user to interact with the application to complete a task or achieve a\n                                    particular\n                                    goal. The UI includes all the visible on-screen elements, such as buttons, menus,\n                                    text, and\n                                    images, as well as the layout and design of these elements. The goal of UI design is\n                                    to\n                                    create\n                                    an interface that is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and intuitive for the\n                                    user. The\n                                    UI is\n                                    a vital aspect of the user experience (UX), as it directly impacts how the user\n                                    interacts\n                                    with a\n                                    product and their overall satisfaction with the experience. The UI is essential\n                                    because it\n                                    serves as the primary point of interaction between users and digital products or\n                                    systems. A\n                                    visually appealing and consistent UI can help build trust and reinforce a brand's\n                                    values and\n                                    personality, while a poorly designed UI can lead to confusion, frustration, and user\n                                    abandonment.\n                                    Therefore, a well-designed UI is crucial to providing an optimal user experience,\n                                    which in\n                                    turn\n                                    can lead to increased engagement, retention, and user satisfaction.\n                                    and\n                                    requirements of your project or organization. You can create new components or\n                                    modify\n                                    existing ones to better suit your needs.\nWHAT IS A DESIGN SYSTEM?\nThe design system is a digitalized library of ready-to-use components and core\n                                    features that promote and simplify collaboration among various designers and\n                                    developers. It comes with a step-by-step guide for designing and coding the\n                                    application.

    "content": "UMANG\nAbout this apparrow_forwardUMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) is envisaged to make e-governance 'mobile first'. It is developed by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and National e-Governance Division (NeGD).                                                                                                     It is an evolving platform designed for citizens of India to offer them access to the pan-India e-Gov services from the Central, State, Local Bodies, and Agencies of government on app, web, SMS, and IVR channels. Key Features:- Unified Platform: It brings together all government departments and their services on a single platform to provide better and easier services to citizens.- Mobile First Strategy: It aligns all government services with the mobile first strategy to leverage mobile adoption trends.    - Integration with Digital India Services: It provides seamless integration with other Digital India Services like Aadhaar, DigiLocker, and PayGov.

The sensitive profile data is saved in an encrypted format and no one can view this information.                Key Services:UMANG provides easy access to a plethora of Indian government services ranging from – Healthcare, Finance, Education, Housing, Energy, Agriculture, Transport to even Utility and Employment and Skills. Key Benefits for Citizens:- Single-Point Ubiquitous Access: All government services are available for citizens on a unified platform for easy access through multiple online and offline channels (SMS, email, app, and web).      - More for Less: Only a single mobile app needs to be installed instead of each app of each department.- Convenience: Citizens do not even need to install or update the app again to avail government services if more services are added to the platform.- Saving of Time and Money: Citizens can anytime and anywhere avail these services through their mobile phones, desktops, and laptops without any need for visiting the department office and standing in queues.- Uniform Experience: All the government services including payment-based transactions provide secure and uniform experience.Updated onMay 5, 2025Productivity\nAbout this app\nData safetyarrow_forwardSafety starts with understanding how developers collect and share your data.

Most features like claim status, passbook, and Aadhaar linking simply don’t work. It keeps showing “server error” or crashes randomly. For a government service handling something as important as retirement funds, this is unacceptable. Even after multiple updates, nothing seems to improve. Please fix these issues and make the app more reliable — people depend on this!177 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMeitY, Government Of IndiaApril 29, 2025Dear Abhi, We regret the inconvenience caused. We want to inform you, EPFO services are working fine; however, due to heavy traffic at EPFO servers, citizens may face server errors. We request you to try again now. If you are facing any challenges please email us at customercare@umang.gov.in or call us at 10505.\nAnil Vishwakarmamore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 20, 2025This app used to work wonderfully, but over time, it has become increasingly frustrating. It crashes frequently, and lately, the issue has become more persistent, often displaying a message that says, \"Try again after some time.\" I'm not sure if this problem is limited to Android users, but it's been quite disappointing. I primarily use this app for EPFO services, and for the past few months, it's been failing to deliver. As a result, I’m reducing my rating from 5 stars to 2.217 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMeitY, Government Of IndiaApril 21, 2025Dear Anil, We regret for the inconvenience. We have already identified the issue and raised it to support team. The team is working, and it will get resolved very soon, and you will be able to use seamless services at UMANG again. Your patience is highly appreciated till the time.\nJasmine Sayedmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 15, 2025I appreciate the idea behind the UMANG app bringing multiple government services under one roof is great in theory. However, the execution falls short in many areas. Most services, especially EPFO, frequently show errors or are under maintenance. The app is often slow, and logging in can be frustrating due to issues with OTp's not working. As a citizen trying to access basic services, this kind of unreliability defeats the purpose. I hope the developers focus on improving backend stability......336 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMeitY, Government Of IndiaApril 16, 2025Dear User, We regret for the inconvenience. EPFO services are currently interrupted from the department's side. We are in touch with the department and working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

    "content": "\nPrivacy & Terms\n\nPrivacy & Terms\nGoogle Privacy Policy\nWhen you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nPrivacy Checkup\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\nTake the Privacy Checkup\nContents\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\nThings you create or provide to us\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\nGo to Google Account\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in  My Ad Center.\nGo to My Ad Center\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\nGo to Privacy Checkup\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\nPrivacy controls\nActivity Controls\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\nGo to Activity Controls\nAd settings\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\nGo to My Ad Center\nAbout you\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\nGo to About You\nShared endorsements\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\nGo to Shared Endorsements\nSites and apps that use Google services\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\nWays to review & update your information\nMy Activity\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\nGo to My Activity\nGoogle Dashboard\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\nGo to Dashboard\nYour personal information\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\nGo to Personal Info\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\nExport your data\nTo delete your information, you can:\nDelete your information\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\nSharing your information\nWhen you share your information\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\nWhen Google shares your information\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\nWith your consent\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\nWith domain administrators\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\nFor external processing\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.\nFor legal reasons\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\nKeeping your information secure\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\nYou can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\nWe regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.\nData transfers\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live.

We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\nAbout this policy\nWhen this policy applies\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google LLC and its affiliates, including YouTube, Android, and services offered on third-party sites, such as advertising services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.\nThis Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to:\nChanges to this policy\nWe change this Privacy Policy from time to time.

Learn more about the companies providing business services in the EU.\nAlgorithm\nA process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.\nApplication data cache\nAn application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.\nBrowser web storage\nBrowser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in \"local storage\" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.\nCookies\nA cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.\nDevice\nA device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.\nGoogle Account\nYou may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.\nIP address\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information.\nNon-personally identifiable information\nThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.\nPersonal information\nThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.\nPixel tag\nA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.\nReferrer URL\nA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.\nSensitive personal information\nThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.\nServer logs\nLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\nA typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:\nUnique identifiers\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.\nAdditional Context\nActivity on Google Services\nIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.\nIn some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.\nYou can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.\nactivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\nWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.\nThis information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.\nYou can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.\nads you’ll find most useful\nFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.\nadvertising and research services on their behalf\nFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.\nAndroid device with Google apps\nAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.\ncustomized search results\nFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.\ndeliver our services\nExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:\ndetect abuse\nWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.\ndevices\nFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.\nensure and improve\nFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.\nensure our services are working as intended\nFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.\nInformation about things near your device\nIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more\nlegal process, or enforceable governmental request\nLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.\nmake improvements\nFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.\nmay link information\nGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more\nour users\nFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more.\npartner with Google\nThere are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more\npayment information\nFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.\nWe may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more\npersonalized ads\nYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more\nphone number\nIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more\nPlaces you label like home and work\nYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.\nYou can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.\nprotect against abuse\nFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).\npublicly accessible sources\nFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.\nrely on cookies to function properly\nFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more\nsafety and reliability\nSome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:\nsensitive categories\nWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.\nSensor data from your device\nYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information.\nservers around the world\nFor example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.\nservices to make and receive calls or send and receive messages\nExamples of these services include:\nshow trends\nWhen lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more\nsimilar information related to your physical or mental health\nspecific Google services\nFor example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.\nspecific partners\nFor example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.\nsynced with your Google Account\nYour Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more\nthe people who matter most to you online\nFor example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.\nthe public\nFor example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.\nthird parties\nFor example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.\nuse the information we collect across our services\nDepending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:\nViews and interactions with content and ads\nFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.\nVoice and audio information\nFor example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more\nyour activity on other sites and apps\nThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.\nLearn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps."

    "content": "\nPrivacy & Terms\n\nPrivacy & Terms\nGoogle Terms of Service\nEffective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\nCountry version: India\nWhat’s covered in these terms\nWe know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.\nThese Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nTerms\nService provider\nGoogle services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:\nGoogle LLCorganized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA1600 Amphitheatre ParkwayMountain View, California 94043USA\nAge requirements\nIf you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\nIf you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.\nContents\nYour relationship with Google\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its affiliates, excluding any local entities based in India. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money.\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\nMany of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.\nDevelop, improve, and update Google services\nWe’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\nOur  service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nDon’t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat’s covered\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat’s not covered\nScope\nRights\nThis license allows Google to:\nPurpose\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\nDuration\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nIf you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\nUsing Google services\nYour Google Account\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\nYou’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\nService-related communications\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\nSome of our services allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\nGoogle content\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.\nSoftware in Google services\nSome of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\nSome of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.\nIn case of problems or disagreements\nBoth the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.\nWarranty\nWe provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.\nDisclaimers\nThe only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the Warranty section; (2) the service-specific additional terms; and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.\nDon’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\nBoth the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms.\nOther than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.\nFor business users and organizations only\nIf you’re a business user or organization:\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\nCalifornia law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.\nTo the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google.

We're overjoyed to hear you're having a great time playing. Your support is truly appreciated!Ambermore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMarch 21, 2025Wow! Ludo king is an amazing game!..said no one ever. The algorithm is 'randomly' designed to make you lose, and the opponent rolls are always 'conviniently' in their favour. The algorithm appears to be flawed leading to unrealistic and frustrating gameplay. I mean, who needs fair gameplay when you can just rig the system? Plus it has a lot of ads. 1/5 stars on this worst app,wound not recommend.3,972 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKeerthana Manojmore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 15, 2024Been playing the game for many years. The recent update makes in unable to choose the colour we want to play. You can by either watching an ad, making a one-time purchase or losing 25 diamonds (it was 10 last update and increased it to 25). I stopped playing the game because of this. Isn't choosing colours you like basic? Does it always have to be about money?

But the worst thing about this recently is the ads after every over. It's not a problem for me to watch an ad of 10-15 seconds but what really frustrating is that once the ad is completed when I try to close the ad it takes me out of the game to the ad installation page. When I go back to the game tab, I have to restart 😒. This is really the worst thing especially when I have to spend my little free time playing this. 😣😣.5,501 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoNautilus MobileJanuary 31, 2025We are sorry for the issues you faced.

However, I am currently facing an issue with the shot map feature in the game. Whenever I attempt to customize and save batting shots in the shot map, the changes are not being applied. Despite saving my preferred shots, the game continues to apply the default shots during gameplay. This issue is affecting my overall experience with the game.

How it is possible the same player (Captain) can be 2 different places at the same time? 3) Except for easy mode, rest all other modes are very difficult to bat, even hitting ball on time batsmen gets out. 4) There are many mistakes in speeches and commentary. 5) No highlights options at all.

But there are few bugs. 1. Even after getting a player from draw or whatever sometimes it takes even 24 hours to reflect on account (have faced the problem twice). 2. The energy restore system is quite buggy, i.e. sometimes it shows I have 52 energy (for example) and after playing 1 match now I am left with 40 energy (I think it's a glitch that's not important for gameplay but can be irritating). 3.

The game becomes tedious and boring after you start getting World Class players. The progress slows down dramatically, and you just play with the same 2 or 3 players all the time. The single player is boring, as you know what teams you are going to beat before the game starts. Multiplayer is pure garbage. It's long winded, boring, unfair and luck based. This entire game is luck based, and why there is a competitive aspect, I would never know.170 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoStOrMmore_vert Flag inappropriateJanuary 25, 2025The gameplay is really good even with 100s of bugs in it, I've spent close to 100 hrs and I still login and play everyday. Main reason to vote 2 stars is because of the Equipments in the game. You can get several equipments like gloves, pads etc etc, once you equip that on a player, you cannot remove it to put it on a different player. The only way to remove it is to sell the equipment. This makes no sense as you will need the ability to remove and equip it on better player as when you get one.255 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoHitwicket Cricket GamesJanuary 28, 2025Hey there,\nWe've forwarded your feedback to our developers on Equipment.

However, the ads are becoming way too intrusive and makes me not want to play as much. I don't mind ads since the game is free. But some ads are repetitive, unskippable and over a minute long.

I didn't even mind paying for the ad free version. If someone makes a good game, I have no problem paying them. However, needing coins to solve hidden words is terrible. I got to level 55 and am out of coins so I either have to go back to watch ads (for very few coins) or I have to pay for coins. So, spend $5 for ad free and am stuck at level 55 since I don't want to spend more money nor do I want to watch multiple long ads.330 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newBug fixes and performance boosts!

Currently if you want to open any specific lootcase then you have to open it one at a time and each time you have to find that lootcase down the line to open it again. Which is very annoying and frustrating. Please fix this in next update.1 person found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoReliance GamesMay 8, 2025Thank you for your suggestion!

The difficulty is ridiculous for starting levels and AI opponents can use UNLIMITED REVERSALS TO WIN! How is that fair? I finally quit this BS after making it pretty far into story, my team is stronger and I'm close to winning but the AI opponents can just reverse every special attack to come back and win. I don't get how hard is it to make a fair game, I try hard not to just give out 1 stars but some game deserve it.

Don't try to run after the reward points and play it endlessly.. The developers have many restrictions and hidden clauses on awarding reward points to its customers, so you might not get them even if you think you will, by playing and winning so much.. But for the sake of playing and enjoying, it's fun....3,162 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newMAY-hem Begins – Wyatt Sicks Take Over!The Wyatt Sicks invade WWE Mayhem with dark, twisted chaos!

Firstly and most importantly the ads aren't excessive. 2. Graphics and sound effects are pretty good. 3. The UI could use a little tuning, the \"fine adjustment\" by dragging on the top part of the screen could be better. Maybe a dial like other games use? 4. As other reviews mention the gameplay mechanics could be better, vis-a-vis AI errors made, and the length the balls especially the cue ball travels based on power of shot.1,167 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoBrian Kerrmore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 7, 2024It's an ok game. However...it doesn't allow for free ball nominations, or making an opponent replay from the snookerd position. Also, I would have liked to use my own picture as an avatar as yours is very limited in options. Plus depending on the level played, the CPU makes some odd choices in ball selection. Aiming aids are quite good & useful. And lastly I wouldn't mind a referee face, male or female, calling fouls & scores, or some applause at times...It'll add a nice touch to it.160 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAndreas Böhmmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 1, 2025First things first: the controls are fairly intuitive and work well. Potting and building frames is a lot of fun and the game looks good. The computer opponents make no sense, though. They always try to play using the small colors. Difficulty settings makes little difference. The worst miss in this game is how found are handled. You can't let the opponent take the next shot and there's no \"miss\" rule. This robs the game of some of the most important aspects of Snooker.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newWe hope you're having fun playing Real Snooker 3D!

I'm a really big fan of the gameplay and the art style. I have just 2 things that I think will make this game even better. I noticed when using perks you collected, you lose 1 of them even if you didn't use it at all in the match. If this does change and the team needs a way to balance it out, maybe make getting perks a little bit more difficult.

No options to just buy the game to remove ads. The \"energy\" mechanic consistantly ruins games. You cannot keep playing unless pay, watch ads, or wait 2 minutes to gain 1 merge action. So the game(s) is telling me to play a different game and not this one. Find other ways to monetize your games devs.... I'm sure you make some money just from copy and pasting other games. Otherwise you wouldn't take the lazy route and feed off the stupid.11 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTheAppGuruzFebruary 28, 2025Thank you for your feedback!See all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s new🐞 Bug Fixes 🔷 Performance Optimisations\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailmergefever@gmail.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer APPGURUZ  techadroit2@gmail.com  Nandanvan, Street no. 4, Saurashtra Kala Kendra Society\noff Nirmala Convent\nRajkot, Gujarat 360005\nIndia  +91 99256 08822\nApp support\nMore by TheAppGuruzarrow_forwardCarrom Cricket: Disc Pool GameTheAppGuruz3.6starIndian Cooking Star: Chef GameTheAppGuruz4.3starAsian Cooking Games: Star ChefTheAppGuruz4.3starStyle & Makeover: Merge PuzzleTheAppGuruz3.7starSherlock: Mystery MergeTheAppGuruz4.3starAmerican Cooking Games: ChefTheAppGuruz4.0star\nMore by TheAppGuruz\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardMystery Town - Merge & CasesCedar Games StudioMerge Diner - Restaurant GamesONE HIT CO., LIMITED3.4starMerge Resto - Match & DecorTAAP GAME STUDIO4.0starFlambé: Merge & CookMicrofun Limited4.3starMerge Passion: Love DecorCSCMobi Studios4.1starOnce Upon a MergeGamesTown4.3star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

Statistics can be made much better. Overall statistics is a waste, since different types of game means seperate statistics. 2. There should be an option to see the kill numbers while playing the game. 3. If we can apply the skin of the worm we defeated, it would be awesome 4.

The game says we can watch ads to gain weight or play gain if we die or even upgrade Power ups for the worms but- they never seem to work. I can say with guarantee that I have clicked at those ads for 50 times to double my coins but they say 'not available now try again later boy if not now then when??

I've beaten almost all 3 levels of each stage of Earth, and leveled up the maximum for both my mini ships and maxed the level for my main ship then evolved it and I still CAN'T get past Mercury boss levels. They have no business being that hard on a MOBILE game, it feels like I'd need a controller and hours repeatedly learning each boss level to beat each of their strategies since they get harder if you don't kill them soon enough.858 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo1SOFTNovember 26, 2024Hi Captain, you don't have to pay anything if you don't want to.

It takes 5-10 seconds for all the enemies to come, so specially in hunger game I kinda face timeout most of the time...

But when the moves are exhausted, it is too much to pay 900 for just 5 moves. And at times just 1-2 moves are enough to get over with the game. Money gets exhausted very soon. Love the merge mode games. Keep continuing with them please. They are really fun. The hunt expedition that keeps coming up often takes up too many energies in just clearing half a minute thrash. In three turns all 100 energies are exhausted. Bring more of merge mode games.

But I'm really disappointed in the recent update, as it's interface is looking like just any other game, the uniqueness is disappeared. The old style was classic and was soothing to eyes, please bring back the old style. One more thing, there was a event where u could put up a request in the group chat for other members to solve ur level when it is difficult, that was one of the best part of game.

This has become impossible to win. It shouldn't take every possible booster to win an easy level just to face a super hard level immediately after. Then waiting until you can get boosters via daily spin, just to lose them all without ever coming close to beating a super hard level. And repeat ad nauseum. And please, stop saying that every change made to the game is in order to \"enhance\" our playing experience. This is a blatant lie, and we all know it.204 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoPlayrixMarch 20, 2025Hi! We appreciate your honest feedback.

Mine is currently over 6GB with the cashe cleared. I love this game so much, and it has so many different adventures to choose from. Every time the app updates, it gets worse. The art style is devolving and it is nearly impossible to do the actual map adventure once you get far. 60 energy isn't enough anymore, and it's become a money grab. The events are generous with rewards tho.169 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoVIZOR APPS LTD.March 15, 2025Hello!

If you planned well, you could keep playing. Then they changed the art style to look like every other game, and that was bad enough, but it was most unfortunate when it turned into another money hungry Gatcha game. You used to be able to get some really cool items during events, now it's nearly impossible.

I do everything to get extra energy like from the animals, the chests in the games, the gift box and anything else that gives energy. I want to be able to play more than 30 mins without buying. It's addictive, I'm running out of money and there is no way to keep playing for hrs like I want to do. It cost to much to cut or clear things out.

I have been playing this game since 3 years. It's an amazing game and I love it! But there's one problem, sometimes when I play it suddenly my game restarts on its own! It's really annoying. I lost 3 years of progress because of this glitch. I would rate this game 5 stars if this glitch wasn't there. I love Toca Boca but it would be very nice of you if you fix this glitch soon. Thank you!14,829 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoHarmony Richardsmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyFebruary 13, 2025I absolutely love toca boca, but it keeps glitching, resetting, and not working! Things randomly disappear, or the game won't load. I've tried reinstalling it and resetting my phone, but it still doesn't work! I've contacted the support team, but they did not help! I've spent at least £60 on this game over the years, and it's upsetting! Terrible customer service, terrible glitches, and overall a terrible game! Do not recommend!

It's soo amazing! But sometimes my characters glitch and they duplicate clothes they put on. Also, I cannot get on the shop so I can't claim some free packs or buy anything. That's really annoying,because I want to buy stuff! Also, I think the make-up wipes should take off All the make-up, not just blush. Also, I wish that you could access all characters on the phone,insteadof just a few. Also, I can't go onto other people's worlds because I cant get codes.

It's genuinely great and I want to thank you for giving us so much free content! One thing I would love added is more characters we can play with (they don't necessarily have to be custom ones that we can make from scratch, just new characters in the phone) I've noticed some of the bugs have been fixed which is great, but the secrets/quests are still a bit janky.

The game has gotten a bit buggy over the past few updates, like the missing clothing animations and stuff isn't working the way it should, also the issue with the new hairdresser furniture if you use the new patterns but switch to a solid colour it always switches back which is inconvenient. so hopefully it's being worked on. other than a few bugs the game is experiencing rn it's all great.10,386 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newYou've got mail!We are unboxing our new Post Office, and you better believe we packed many cool surprises in those envelopes...Help us deliver the message and spread it across town with our brand new Delivery Truck!\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailinfo@pazugames.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer PAZU GAMES LTD  info@pazugames.com  1 Ha-Tsmikha\nYOKNEAM ILLIT, 2066733\nIsrael  +1 864-387-4136\nApp support\nMore by Pazu Gamesarrow_forwardMakeup Girls - Games for kidsPazu Games3.7starGirls Nail Salon - Kids GamesPazu Games4.1starNail Art Salon - ManicurePazu Games3.9starAvatar Maker Dress up for kidsPazu Games2.9starPizza maker cooking gamesPazu Games3.9starMakeup Girls: Dress up gamesPazu Games3.7star\nMore by Pazu Games\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardToca Boca WorldToca Boca4.2starAha World: Doll Dress-Up GameAha World Ltd.4.4starBarbie Dreamhouse AdventuresBudge Studios3.9starToca Boca JrPlay Piknik3.8starEmma's World - Town & FamilyBeansprites LLC3.6starMy PlayHome PlusShimon Young : Play Home Software3.7star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

You have the story of the missing brother which seems good so far, but you also have this bullying character makes no sense. They strike me as more of a plot device than a character. As far as gameplay goes, it's inconsistent. Some parts a smooth and others are clunky and make little sense.1 person found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKrystal Johnsonmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyApril 11, 2025I love this game, however here lately it kicks you out and doesn't save progress and as a bonus it doesn't give you back your energy used, also the side quests take a ridiculous amount of energy and that's most of the game. it seems more of a \"pay me\" game then it's worth for the hassles of it constantly closing and restarting on you is worth.

I really enjoyed the live street map as I could see detailed layouts all over the world. They've since updated it and it only allows you to zoom in so far now to a pixelated mess. I do intend on keeping the app so I can continue to progress, but it's disappointing that certain features that worked have been removed. It would be nice to see a log of your aircraft aside from the maintenance menu. It is too easy to duplicate airplane IDs currently.62 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoXombat Development - Airline manager gamesMarch 19, 2025Hi,\nWe've forwarded your feedback to our developers.

The one problem is that The hanger fee, it becomes too expensive like 4 billon dollars for 10 airplanes. Many people want to have short and medium haul airplanes, but the hanger fee becomes too much. I think that the best option is to limit the hanger fee to 500 million or near that range after a certain amount of hangers are built. If this is fixed then the game will be much better with more fun.270 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoXombat Development - Airline manager gamesMarch 23, 2025Thank you for the feedback.

Thank you for the feedback 🙌We want to clarify that there is no option to change the enlarged area of the puzzle – it is done automatically. You will be moved to the next part only when you fully complete the first part (the top left corner). This is the way the current Zoom system works.Ryan Raymondmore_vert Flag inappropriateMarch 14, 2025This game is super relaxing. I have been playing it for almost a year. You can also get paid to play it through the app mistplay. So it's a no-brainer. If you like puzzles, they got them. I just wouldn't do the highest piece puzzle unless you're on a tablet or computer due to the pieces being so small. Oh yeah, and no force ads, but I'm not sure if that's because I paid to have them removed. I do that to most games I like. That thing I'll say is enjoy my fellow puzzle builders 👷‍♀️ 😉.300 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoZiMADMarch 14, 2025Hello!

Lealmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 29, 2025Not good anymore. Full of ads, everything's paid (though little worth spending) and \"socializing\" can get under the skin, due toxic players. Also, it's filled with hackers. On the bright side, it has nice graphics, fps count and customization. I haven't had any problems with the game crashing or anything but, some of you may experience that. Me... I wouldn't recommend this game nowadays.

First is that the new currency (crowns) can only be received via purchases and takes ages to earn coins. It also gets repetitive once you've made a lot of purchases. It's an ok game with great graphics but it can be a real drain with all the purchasing required. Still an ok game but for close to six months now I can't even load the game. This is apparently a recurring issue with a lot of people. I probably won't play again if this keeps up.2,563 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoLockwood Publishing LtdDecember 30, 2024We understand your point of view and we are always working to improve the gaming experience.

The design feature is great. Socializing is Fun. Yet, there is no idle or do not disturb feature. Favorites list in all categories is so limited. Especially in friends list. You can only be in 1 group. I dont see how u can be in multiple. Hugs and some interactions should have a basic free version; it costs way too much to interact with people its actually sickening. I do like the verify account feature for adults. Crafting features shouldn't cost just crowns.122 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoLockwood Publishing LtdFebruary 5, 2025Thank you for your feedback!

It's takes a lot of time to complete the quest and the time for competition is comparatively too less with this respect.

What really like is there are hardly any ads. Only when you want something in exchange like speed ups or extra playing tokens. And in game pop up ads for in game purchases are only 3 at a time.

The graphic not being too cartoonish gives additional immersion too. But it's got some stuff that needs to be addressed. Lack of alternative to mictrotransactions for one. Then, the terrible feature to help scaling the balance in form of income statements. Like what's what goes where, and at what period, this lacks in the game, so you can't properly manage your money because you can't see the numbers properly5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoPlayrionApril 14, 2025Hi,\nWe've forwarded your feedback to our developers.

One I can't build a boarding gate at ramp 4. Don't know if it's a bug or I'm doing something wrong. and another something it's show few members are missing in the plane while boarding. but once I close the app and come back. it shows 100% passengers are boarded. also sometimes it reduces the percentage of filling fue or catring.Did you find this helpful?YesNoPlayrionApril 22, 2025We will fix the problem.

So that we can have an best experience and it will an add on to the simulation.

The graphics are so realistic and smooth, the dinosaur are cool, & the battle style also crazy. There are so many options to fight and after winning, prize is ready. I like the overall game except one point. You should add a practice mode and an offline mode because after playing one match, the dinosaurs required rest for 3-4 hours. So, practice mode is essential for that with no rest. And an offline mode to play whenever players want.

Ruins game. I love game but the app crashes if I need to switch to another app. The game acts like I lost the level. Any boosters used during the level are gone. All the streak-win boosters from \"Bonnie\" are gone and I have to start over. EVEN WORSE: if you make a wrong move with a bull, there are some levels you can't pass at all even if you use boosters. That means you lose your streak boosters no matter what. Makes me not want to play.202 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSaba Mehakmore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 12, 2024It's fun to play.

I love this game. The graphics are great. You can actually move move around during a round. Multiple weapons to unlock and upgrade. And you only have to spend real money if you want the barbed wire wrapped bat (Be honest. Who doesn't.) But a few of the ads make the game crash and reload. While you don't lose forward progress (unless it's on the daily) it does get a little frustrating. Fix this problem and I'll gladly up it to 5 stars.138 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoNeal Angmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyAugust 26, 2024Game works pretty well, almost no glitches or bugs encountered, and slaying zombies (especially the daily missions) feels very satisfying. My only complaints are the ads: like the xp rewards; the first rewards are some diamonds which you can only collect by watching an ad, and you can't collect the others until you do. After every level is a forced ad, skippable but annoying regardless.146 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoChirag Bhutanimore_vert Flag inappropriateOctober 7, 2023The game is enjoyable.

I used to play this game with last year but some problems are same like whenever we want to simulate the game it doesn't show any ad.

One more thing, the game isn't loading my previous progress before uninstallation. The account was connected with Google play, but still I am having to start over. It's a bit frustrating.

Brings back the old og memories. The problem is just that there are way toooo many ads. If there would be a single ad after a game it's understandable but there is an ad as soon as you open the game and multiple ads after the game ends. The only upside is there are no ads between the game. Reduce the ads and this will be the best truck simulator game out there. Also please add the smart traffic feature makes the game far better.8,276 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoReuben Jamesmore_vert Flag inappropriateFebruary 4, 2025Overall, the game has pros and cons. Sadly, the cons are bad enough to make me delete the game. Pros: - great controls (turn signals, horn, access to mirrors, headlights) - cool concept (own a trucking company, manage trucks, employ truckers) Cons: - the physics suck. particularly the reverse gear physics (the trailer acts very weird). it's also possible to turn sharply and near full speed without slipping - the ads are long and unbearable294 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newTruck Simulator : Europe- Some bug fixes have been made.\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailhelp@zuuks.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer ZUUKS OYUN YAZILIM VE PAZARLAMA ANONIM SIRKETI  support@zuuks.com  ZORLU CENTER BLOK, NO:2/477 LEVAZIM MAHALLESI\nKORU SOKAK, BESIKTAS\n34340 Istanbul (Europe)\nTürkiye  +90 850 622 9096\nApp support\nMore by Zuuks Gamesarrow_forwardTruck Simulator : UltimateZuuks Games4.2starBus Simulator Ultimate : IndiaZuuks Games4.3starTraffic Driver 2Zuuks Games3.4starGANGS ValleyZuuks Games3.7starWord Match 3D - Master PuzzleZuuks Games3.6star\nMore by Zuuks Games\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardTruck StarCentury Games PTE.

If you have a small phone, the steering is pretty small and one time out of three you rotate the screen instead of the steering. It would greatly improve the game to have rear work lights on the tractors so you can see what the implement is doing. If possible, please add. Thanks if you will.1,155 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoStevemore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMarch 8, 2025Well I see some changes for the better, like tire tracks in the ground, but we need animal transport trailers that can haul more than the rediculous amount of 10 animals. Takes way to long to reduce a head count of 1000. Another annoying thing is buying another tractor, as an add on, it upsets where you need to put it and then having to tap around to find it in my machine stock when needed, unlike the earlier versions. I am tempted to buy the 20 version but hesitate over having Joe and his dog.1,452 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newJohn Deere 8245 R tractorROPA Panther 2 sugar beet harvesterHOLMER Terra Dos T4-40 sugar beet harvesterGRIMME Varitron 470 potato harvesterAdded Turkish languageVarious fixes and improvements\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsitephonePhone number+80032764357emailSupport emailsupport@giants-software.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer GIANTS Software GmbH  support@giants-software.com  Meierhofweg 5\n8454 Buchberg\nSwitzerland  +41 76 722 45 99\nApp support\nMore by GIANTS Softwarearrow_forwardFarming Simulator 14GIANTS Software4.1starFarming Simulator 16GIANTS Software4.2starFarming Simulator 20GIANTS Software4.5star₹690.00Farming Simulator KidsGIANTS Software₹340.00Farming Simulator 23 MobileGIANTS Software4.6star₹750.00\nMore by GIANTS Software\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardBig Farm: Mobile HarvestGoodgame Studios3.2starTransport Tycoon Empire: CityAlda Games3.8starIt's Literally Just MowingProtostar3.8starGlobal City: Build and HarvestMYGAMES MENA FZ LLC3.3starTruck Manager - 2025Xombat Development - Airline manager games3.2starForklift Extreme SimulatorLast Man Gaming3.9star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

But it can be taken to the next level. Some things I would really love in the game are - 1. Multiplayer mode, 2. Net shots can be better. It shows ' Perfect ' and still hits the net, 3. Not able to defend the smash but the AI defends the smash, 4. Endurance sometimes doesn't work as it claims. 5. Body language can also be improved in each shot. Apart from these, the game is well made.20,257 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s new🏸🏸🏸🏸🏸🏸-Fix BugsEnjoy this awesome badminton world!\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailbadminton@redfishgame.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer Magic Seven Co., Limited  Redfish.gpcs24@outlook.com  Rm H020 3/F KWAI SHING INDL BLDG PH 2\n42-46 TAI LIN PAI RD\n葵涌\nHong Kong  +852 5749 0406\nApp support\nMore by RedFish Gamesarrow_forwardHospital Frenzy: Clinic GamesRedFish Games4.1starAirplane Cooking - Chef GameRedFish Games\nMore by RedFish Games\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardBadminton Clash 3DMiniclip.com4.2starTennis Clash: Multiplayer GameWildlife Studios4.4starPing Pong FuryYakuto4.5starVolleyball Arena: Spike HardMiniclip.com4.4star3D TennisMouse Games4.1starThe Spike Cross - VolleyballSUNCYAN4.5star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

It's a fairly well done cover shooter with weapons, characters, and skills to unlock and upgrade. The reality of the situation is at some point, somehow, you will not be able to play. Whether it's waiting for upgrades, event tickets, level energy, you will not be able to do anything. There needs to be a casual mode without a timer or requirement, so you can play while you wait for redundant timers to finish.264 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s new+ bug fixes\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailsupport@vivastudios.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer VIVA GAMES SOCIEDAD LIMITADA.  adminviva@vivastudios.com  AVENIDA REPUBLICA ARGENTINA, 25 - PISO 8\n41011 SEVILLA\nSpain  +34 673 83 12 57\nApp support\nMore by Viva Games Studiosarrow_forwardGummy Bear Run: Running GamesViva Games Studios3.2starGuns at Dawn: West ShooterViva Games Studios4.1starRunner odyssey:running journeyViva Games Studios3.6starRamboat - Offline Action GameViva Games Studios3.9starZombie Hunter: OfflineViva Games Studios3.9starMini Soccer Star 2024 FootballViva Games Studios4.6star\nMore by Viva Games Studios\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardGun Shooting Games Offline FPSbyss mobile3.9starInvasion: Aerial WarfareTap4fun (Hong Kong) Limited3.4starFrontline Heroes: WW2 WarfareHoma4.1starWorld war 2 1945: ww2 gamesCriss Cross Games2.7starFire Sniper Cover: FPS offlineBrayang Studio3.8starRamboat - Offline Action GameViva Games Studios3.9star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

Immersive, depth-filled, classic characters. But if you're trying to level up? You'll come to a screeching halt, as you're capped in what you can do on a daily basis. Taking multiple days to get through one level? Not fun at all. 2300 XP's between levels? Not fun at all. Completely killed the experience for me. Finding a balance between lengthening the game and promoting gameplay would be nice.177 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKiran Kumarimore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMarch 27, 2025It is a great game. In this game you have to collect characters, upgrade them and fight. Many missions are available to complete. Multiple Campaigns, Cosmic Crucible, Arena and much more. One fault that I think every player would agree with me upon is that training modules are very hard to farm. Slowly as you get higher in level, upgrading characters starts consuming more and more modules while having less modes to earn them. If you improve on this, next time I will give you 5 stars.15 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGreg Hmore_vert Flag inappropriateMarch 8, 2025It's a good game but not perfect. It could do with more quality of life improvements such as gifting to fellow alliance members to aid progress or levelling characters when stuck behind the very expensive paywall. You can progress F2P but it's a bit of a slog and when you do catch up a new team is relased and then your behind again!

If you love challenging games, then this is what you're looing for! The only thing that I don't like is that they give us the resource (which we use to play the levels) very few and takes time to recover 😔. I would prefer to add a event for some time in which you have unlimited access of resourceor you get 5-10 resources in just a few minutes.

For every level it uses 10 supplies, so i can play this game for like 20 mins and then it takes hours to refill those supplies, but we can watch ads for that, but for each ads we gain one supplies (so if you have patience and strength to watch so many ads then go on).

You have the story of the missing brother which seems good so far, but you also have this bullying character makes no sense. They strike me as more of a plot device than a character.

But if you have the time to just keep going back into it every 4 minutes for 1 energy refill to try to beat the timer it's amazing38 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJam City, Inc.April 12, 2025Hello Krystal, we're sorry for the inconvenience while trying to play.

If you aren't buying in game currency, leveling up some of the cards and your castle can be a bit slow, but the game is fun enough that it doesn't even matter. My only real complaint is that I sometimes get messages about my connection, which cause very noticable lag or match disconnection. I don't think it's necessarily an issue on my end, though I wouldn't honestly mind if it didn't cause me to lose trophies, sometimes.431 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAmol Chaperiamore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 20, 2024The game in itself in rly good and unique. Like, you don't see tower defense games that many which are like this. The art is good, the concept is good, the designs are great. The thing is the rewarding system. It's not generous by any means bcz you're giving us 7 coins per win and then asking 1200 for an epic card...?😕 Okay, maybe it's fair bcz of the challenges you win, but THE problem is that the game is pretty... dead. There are no more updates coming up in this game anymore...☹️ ✨3/5✨36 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoApurv Anandmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyOctober 22, 2020The game is great, UI is awesome. It lags sometime but that can be due to your internet connection as well. What i hated about this game doesn't have a \"level playing field\". The randomness of opening any card from the chest during play is not the right way to go about this game! It provides a luck factor which is not ideal for a strategy based game like CC. What can we do instead: start the chest with the least maina cards first and after all the 12 cards are opened, then do a random shuffle!!4,842 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newMinor fixes.\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailsupport+castlecrush@fungames-forfree.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer Wild Life Inc.  stores-agent@wildlifestudios.com  4 Embarcadero Ctr Ste 3680\nSan Francisco, CA 94111\nUnited States  +55 11 97692-4736\nApp support\nMore by Wildlife Studiosarrow_forwardWar Machines：Tanks Battle GameWildlife Studios3.9starSky Warriors: Airplane GamesWildlife Studios4.3starBlock Craft 3D：Building GameWildlife Studios4.2starSniper 3D：Gun Shooting GamesWildlife Studios4.2starBike Race：Motorcycle GamesWildlife Studios4.1starColorfy: Coloring Book GamesWildlife Studios3.6star\nMore by Wildlife Studios\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardClash of WizardsPlay3654.1starTower Conquest: Tower DefenseSuperGaming4.4starCastle Clash: World RulerIGG.COM4.1starRush Royale: Tower Defense TDMY.GAMES B.V.3.9starZombies Clash: Superheroes WarMobile Play Fun Games4.4starGame of WarriorsPlay3654.4star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

Otherwise, hit us up on the support website https://bit.ly/ldoe_andr_en Stay tuned! 🙌Awfully Hot Coffee Potmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 14, 2025This is honestly one of the most fun and enjoyable mobile games out there. It's unique, it's mid paced, and just a good game. But nothing is perfect. Everything has flaws. For starters, I think it's over monetized a little too much. Nothing wrong with monetization, but it goes a little overkill. Next, dying in general. Aside from being a small setback, if you die with a full inventory, you can't get it all back. And if you die twice, all of that loot you had just vanishes. Its very annoying.60 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKEFIRApril 21, 2025Hi there! Just a heads up that you can only loot the most recent corpse, it's just how the game works. Remember to pack some med kits, bandages, or use the reanimator. And evolving in the game doesn't require any payments. As your character grows, looting will get easier.

It has fun and unique mechanics, which is why I'm still playing, but it's a pay to lose game. Also, at stage 6, I was almost at the hole on my 6th shot, and the bot was at the start, and it gave them the win. that's even worse than anything else.28 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoNeil Skaggsmore_vert Flag inappropriateJanuary 4, 2025The gameplay and concept are nice, and several of the courses are entertaining. However, as others have mentioned, it seems once you've played enough to get to the 5th level, everything is geared against you. Up to that point, I would win ~75-80% of the time. Once at level 5, it's 20%, and these are courses I've played many times. It doesn't matter if a purchase was made. In fact, it seems I started losing more AFTER. Seems geared to get more and more $$$.102 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAmber Rowemore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyJune 5, 2020The game itself is really fun. I enjoy playing. However, on average you will win a match then lose a match. It's too hard to accumulate coins for upgrades & such. You basically cant upgrade your equipment, causing you to lose matches. They want you to spend real money & once you do that....the prices go up for each purchase basically.

But for the boss levels, if you may some extra loot like more resources, so it may help us in the next levels. The boss loot are a 10 to 15 percent more than the normal loot, I wish if it may be rounded to 20 or 25, and can you lower the price a little bit for those armours, cause it is a little more over affordable, and if you want to like, instead of buy from the store instead killing people, it should be costly cuz it is over affordable. Well the overall, it is the best.5,184 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMonaj Raymore_vert Flag inappropriateJune 14, 2020I absolutely liked this game. Especially the recent limited event. I would suggest adding few features for the betterment like story mode for each specific character which would be exciting. The game truly lacks variety of operations and features which makes it tiresome in the long run. Also I am curious of the difference between the online and offline version.3,377 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoZITGAJune 17, 2020Greetings\nThank you for this feedback.

Update: I would to see more characters that I can unlock on top of purchasing characters. And maybe a story mode for each character. That would give it too me that is more replayability. To see what happens on each characters quest on top of all the other modes this game already has. And as it stands now it's a great game simple controls I'm still Loving so far. All of my previous purchases are gone how do i restore them?264 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoZITGAMay 4, 2020Thank you for sharing your opinion with us.

Needs to be an easier way to switch between the guides instead of hitting the pause button tho... Btw, The 12mm ROUND ball is the best. EDIT: I don't think level 807 is even winnable. Pretty sure it's not, at least without spending 5000 coins or more for the powerups. Not fun anymore like that. I like challenging, yet very doable levels. I'm beginning to lose interest because of this one level.

Once download, I quickly realized that this was not the same game that was advertised. Although there are little mini games (not the ones advertised) that you can play in between, you have to reach certain levels to be able to play them. So if you are thinking of downloading this based on an ad, I'd recommend you save yourself some time and storage on your phone and DO NOT install this. If you are a fan of word scramble games, by all means, this is a good choice.64 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoA Google usermore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyOctober 30, 2018Great game. Very addicting. Too many ads, but that's to be expected. One suggestion for improvement - either a) give me a list of the words I've guessed wrong, or b) don't penalize for guessing the same word wrong more than once. Especially frustrating when the word you're guessing is an actual word, just not the right word..603 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoWorzzle GamesOctober 31, 2018Hi, Thanks for the valuable suggestion.

The game is phenomenal and it's very addictive. You need to spend some time understanding the map before you can master it. However, it does feel a bit repetitive at times. Also there is just one single location which is not fun all the time. There is a huge pay to win barrier which restricts us to fewer and low powered weapons. In game upgrades are expensive. I would request for another location since this is a paid game. Paying more to unlock weapons is not acceptable.6,445 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTrishant Singhmore_vert Flag inappropriateJune 15, 2020There is just one map, the interface remain same in every level and mission and that makes it boring after a while, other than that the graphics are awesome, controls are good and gameplay feels good for a while but it gets boring after a while.

I had to periodically use a walk-through to help me, as I'm admittedly not so great with these kinds of puzzles, but it was still fun nonetheless.

They literally force you to pay. I get matched with people who are much stronger than me and who have the premium version. It's almost impossible to progress without premium. The prices of the tanks are exorbitantly high. Also, I don't know why after the latest update, whenever I touch the screen anywhere the tank fires automatically. This is extremely disturbing and I get defeated in matches due to this problem. Please fix this ASAP!!!! Visuals are great tho8,275 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoA Google usermore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 13, 2020Its a good one, but if you want to compete with others you have to upgrade to be a premium member. We may get irritated by intermittent premium membership request as well. And most of the accessories you need to pay outrageous amount. I could find some connection issues even there's a good connection. And sometimes the audio getting muted automatically, especially after seeing an add video to gain fuel or gems. In that case you have reset sound settings.12,190 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoBobby Hollismore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 7, 2025This game is fun to play, but the algorithm sucks, you get matched with other tanks that kill you with one shot and you can hit another tank 5 times and not do any damage to them, even hitting them from behind. I'm tired of getting hit by another tank that isn't even facing you. Biggest clinch in the whole game. Like I said fun game to play if the algorithm for matching was close to the same tanks. While playing tier challenge I have the highest tank for that tier maxed out and can't even win.Did you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newThis update contains some quality of life improvements and fixes.\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailsupport+warmachines@fungames-forfree.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer Wild Life Inc.  stores-agent@wildlifestudios.com  4 Embarcadero Ctr Ste 3680\nSan Francisco, CA 94111\nUnited States  +55 11 97692-4736\nApp support\nMore by Wildlife Studiosarrow_forwardSky Warriors: Airplane GamesWildlife Studios4.3starBlock Craft 3D：Building GameWildlife Studios4.2starSniper 3D：Gun Shooting GamesWildlife Studios4.2starBike Race：Motorcycle GamesWildlife Studios4.1starColorfy: Coloring Book GamesWildlife Studios3.6starTennis Clash: Multiplayer GameWildlife Studios4.4star\nMore by Wildlife Studios\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardMassive Warfare: Tanks PvP WarTinyBytes4.1starWorld of Tanks Blitz™Wargaming Group4.1starHills of SteelSupercharge Mobile4.1starWar Zone: Fight For HomelandHorus Technology Solutions3.7starTank Sniper: 3D Shooting GamesCASUAL AZUR GAMES4.4starTank Force: The Army Games PVPXDEVS LTD4.2star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

I bought a new phone and all my data is gone so what's the point spending time to play, try to make high score, collecting character. It doesn't make sense if we lose all of it in the end. They should give us a space store our progress on server like the other games. I really hate this.113,902 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAnkita Sarkarmore_vert Flag inappropriateMarch 5, 2022Its a very addicting game! But the reason I gave it a 4 stars is because the update kind of made things a bit harder ( in my opinion). For example, I just cant find the settings to change our coin skins. But otherwise, this game would be a full 5 star for sure! At the end, this really is a good game because of the different runner skins, the different maps, the cool features and much more!185,548 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newPerilous pollution strikes Pirate Cove!

I paid $10 for 30 days pass, or so I thought. The so-called Kingdom pass was supposed to give me a 30-day buff to give me extra lives and a better reward track. Instead I got two days. I didn't realize that it went on a calendar month not an actual 4-week period. So because I bought it 2 days before the end of the month that's all the time that I got.

The game is engaging, but it could be even better with the addition of interactive NPCs and AI-controlled cars to bring more life to the streets. Adding more jobs or missions would enhance gameplay, giving players more goals and a sense of purpose. An airport with planes flying overhead would add realism and excitement.

You cannot adjust the size or location of your controls. the fire button is tiny and it's at the very very top of my screen which is unacceptable if you have Man hands. what's the point in the sniper rifle when you can't shoot from buildings. ALSO... players can activate safe any time, you can put a few rounds into them and if they don't like it, they just wuss out, start safe mode and you waste your ammo.

I see this is a recurring issue, as sometimes when I open the game, and I click anything it has to reconnect. sometimes I'll be in the middle of a stage and it has to reconnect. It happens frequently, but the game isn't absolutely unplayable. it's not enjoyable to make progress and have to start over a moment later though.25 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoFansipan LimitedMay 7, 2025Hello, we apologize that you are experiencing connection issues with the game.

Thank you.Jay Patelmore_vert Flag inappropriateAugust 16, 2023Addictive game with nice graphics! But, the game mode is too dark and sometimes you don't even see what you're hitting. Also, there are random connection timeout errors although the connection is totally fine. This happens especially when a dungeon fight is longer like 4 or 5 mins. So, even after playing this long fight, I don't get the rewards because of this error. Overall, a very nice game!

Although it lags, if my opponent has the latest character with them. Like for example; I played the Velora event and all the stages were working fine, until you reach the stage where you have to face Velora herself, there, it starts to lag i don't know why. Overall, the grind is real here! But it's fun and satisfying. The moves made by the charcters are really cool, the option, where you can try out the new characters is good.2,642 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s new- Event Valentine- Fix bugs\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailsupport@fansipan.hkshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer Fansipan Limited  fansipan@fansipan.hk  Rm 1501 15/F PROSPERITY TWR\n39 QUEEN'S RD C\nHong Kong  +852 9283 9850\nApp support\nMore by Fansipan Limitedarrow_forwardSummoners Era: Idle StrategyFansipan Limited4.3star₹50.00₹0.00Shadow Knight: Ninja Game WarFansipan Limited4.5starNightfall: Kingdom Frontier TDFansipan Limited4.7starStickman vs Monster: Idle RPGFansipan Limited4.3starEpic Stickman: Idle RPG WarFansipan Limited4.7starStickman Dungeon: Idle RPG WarFansipan Limited4.5star\nMore by Fansipan Limited\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardStickman Legends Offline GamesZITGA4.3star₹59.99Shadow of Death: Offline GamesBrave HK Limited4.5starShadow of Death: Dark KnightBrave HK Limited4.6star₹28.00Stickman Legends Offline GamesZITGA4.2starNinja Must DiePandada Games3.9starShadow Slayer: Demon HunterONDI TECHNOLOGY JSC4.5star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

But there is no feature of aiming..also you should reduce the upgrade price of the weapons...it is almost the same as buying a new weapon (for example, the cost of thumper shotgun is 25,000 cr. and the cost of upgrading akms rifle is 20,000 cr. which is almost equal)..11,682 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAlexandra Falconmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMarch 9, 2025This game is really good, the graphics, sound and even the visual of the zombies are really good and kinda scary.

I love it, and i enjoy it. But, there is a problem. When you reload any weapon, the reloading noises are way off. Id like that bug to be fixed plz. Then, my second small issue is the ragdoll effects. They only work when you blow up zombies with the barrels or a grenade. Can you make ragdoll effects for when you shoot them dead as well. For example, when you shoot a zombie with a shotgun, his body would ragdoll backwards.

As I was progressing though chapters I was presented with the quest \"Defeat 10 Nifflung Leaders\". It had been two weeks of being unable to complete this as it relies entirely on other players, which is an unfair aspect to the game. Other issues I have are that the red dots to alert you there is something important - I cannot ever tell if there's something important in certain areas of the game as they are always on.183 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoVarun Senmore_vert Flag inappropriateDecember 1, 2024To be honest, this game primarily revolves around spending money, no, lot of money! Without spending a significant amount daily, progressing beyond level 20 becomes extremely slow and challenging. Advancement stalls, and completing a single research task can take months. The game's mechanics heavily depend on time, patience, and money.

Too many ads needed to progress, which stinks but the main issue is that even if you watch every ad, you can get stuck. I was making steady progress but now I have all 3 goals related to raising my manager level. it's excruciatingly slow, even with all the ad watching briefcase and side game wins. I might quit playing if I can't get past this in a day or two. same issue with business mode.

There's 1 or 2 specific ads that play, sometimes b2b; and it breaks the game by either crashing or fully restarting the game, thus nullifying any rewards that I may have gained causing a lot of wasted effort. If this issue with the ads is fixed, I'd be willing to give a better review. But like most free games, this issue may never be fixed.133 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKolibri GamesNovember 28, 2024We're disappointed to see that your experience has only been worthy of 1*.

I was completely fine with watching ads to get rewards and not like other game playing ads in the middle. The thing I didnt like, was almost impossible to finish the level without watching ads. I would have watched more than 100ads to complete a level. I thought it would get better, when I started a new bank, but I was playing the same thing again in a loop with different place to development from scratch. making 1 bank to fully functioning it took lot of time too many ads.Did you find this helpful?YesNoKolibri GamesApril 7, 2025We are very sad to see that you only give the game 3 out of 5 stars.

You cannot cancel anything you start, say scouting, training, upgrade, research etc. Then if you want to do something and it is not allowed, half the time, clear reason is not thrown. One case is, once in an alliance, and you try to build an Alliance Stronghold, on attempting to place the structure, it throws the error Unauthorised. That's it!

I never thought T frame would walk on the map while rallying or jungling. That's so cool and awesome . It's not more like pay to win. It's all about the time that you're investing in it.

But it takes a long time to produce goods. When you start these games, it shouldn't take 10 mins to make the simple items. The wait is so long that the tutorial asks you to pay gems to skip. Normally I just wait the 1 minute in a tutorial, but these were 5-10 mins. If it is 5-10 mins in the beginning, it is gonna be forever as you level up and build more buildings.

But there are two issues with the game that need to be addressed: 1. Lot of amounts of things have to be filled up, and at the same time, certain things take too much time to be prepared. 2. To buy things, the expenses are huge. All of a sudden, the player ends up losing a lot of cash in the game. One suggestion is, please come up with a separate marketplace with lets the player sell and buy things easily.22 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newAloha, Islanders,Get ready for new adventures and tasty rewards with the latest update!FEATURES:* Springtime Picnic Event –Starting May 8th, enjoy new recipes and fresh prizes in the Springtime Picnic!* Cruise Tournament Task Rebalance –Tasks in the Cruise Tournament have been better balanced for a smoother experience!Follow us:Facebook https://www.facebook.com/Sunshine-Island-100984132678848 Discord https://discord.gg/bGf7tq3Hnr\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailinfo@goodgamestudios.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer Stillfront Germany GmbH  playstore@goodgamestudios.com  Borselstr. 20\n22765 Hamburg\nGermany  +49 40 238303697\nApp support\nMore by Goodgame Studiosarrow_forwardBig Farm: Mobile HarvestGoodgame Studios3.2starBig FarmGoodgame Studios3.4starEmpire: Four KingdomsGoodgame Studios3.7starWar Alliance - PvP RoyaleGoodgame Studios4.4starBitLife EspañolGoodgame Studios4.6starBitLife FrançaisGoodgame Studios\nMore by Goodgame Studios\nSimilar gamesarrow_forwardFamily Island™ — Farming gameMelsoft Games Ltd4.1starGoodville: Farm Game AdventureGoodville AG4.4starSunrise Village: Farm GameInnoGames GmbH4.4starThe Tribez: Build a VillageGame Insight4.0starEmpire City: Build and ConquerRED BRIX COMPUTER SYSTEMS3.9starFarmington – Farm gameUGO Games4.4star\nSimilar games\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

Turns out other players can attack your compound and pillage your resources. I'm not the sort of person to appreciate this sort of ruthless game play. I would never pillage someone else, so I don't like it being done to me. I find these sorts of rules encourage greed, selfishness, and just plain incivility. So, I'll be uninstalling this game. I don't like the sort of sportsmanship (or lack thereof) it encourages.197 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoIGG.COMJanuary 23, 2025Hi there!

I dislike that sometimes it will take days or weeks to craft a single piece because of the princess drops. Also the recent update with automatically using items is the absolute worst. I can already choose the items myself and if I had a suit on, now I can't use both of them at the same time and it's awful.10 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSaddu Ansarimore_vert Flag inappropriateJanuary 17, 2025The game features beautifully designed outfits across various styles like elegant, cute, cool, and mature.

Now the UI is so cluttered on the sides making it difficult to collect some tips or upgrade certain workstations. There are endless pop ups trying to get you to watch ads or spend money which also gets in the way of playing the game. The ads running in the background are just fine. It takes forever now to complete just one level since the price of upgrading scales with how much you gold you have. The merge events are fun but that's it.

Hire warriors and head into to battle with the zombie hordes to rid your realm of the undead scourge. Turn your army of simple peasant soldiers into an elite squad of mighty knights by merging them, unlock all sorts of village buildings to earn passive income as you progress through the game, and invest your gains back into defense of your realm in this colorful and entertaining adventure game that combines time management with strategy and combat.⚔️ ARE YOU READY FOR BATTLE? ⚔️🛡What heroes are made of: To beat the zombies in battle, you’ll need to level up fast. Hire new troops and merge them with other warriors of the same level to increase their combat effectiveness.🛡Turn plowshares to swords: Your warriors start off having only simple clubs to bludgeon the zombies with, but as you level them up they get battle axes, armor, longswords and more, turning them into real knights and slashing the time it takes to deal with the undead.🛡Climb the tower: Liberate towers, and you’ll discover your warriors are just as useful with bows as they are with swords, dealing ranged attacks on zombies all around them.🛡What is that thing? If you think swarms of skeletal zombies are the worst you’ll have to fight in this game, wait until you see their leaders – each village you come to also has a fearsome monster boss you’ll have to do battle with before you can move on. Make sure you’ve got plenty of high-level warriors to face them 🗡 🧟‍♂️ 👹.IT’S ALL ABOUT RESOURCESGetting back to work⚡️: As you clear areas of the undead, the village will be able to start functioning again, and it’s you that gets the income from the buildings you rescue, including taverns, forges, sawmills and temples.Coining it💰: Buildings will add to the coins you earn from beating zombies in battle. Be sure to collect your earnings regularly to maximize the amount you can invest in your army – hiring new knights gets expensive fast.Joys of automation💡: Make your industries even more efficient by automating revenue collection so that you can enjoy truly passive income while devoting your energies and attention to defense of your kingdom and defeating the undead in battle.If I had a hammer…🔨 The game has a second currency that can also be won in combat and earned from chests. In conjunction with collectible building cards, hammers allow you to upgrade buildings and further increase your earnings.⚔️⚡️PUT THEM TO THE SWORDLooking for a fun casual adventure game that combines easily mastered gameplay with tactical challenges and time-management strategizing?

I paid for no ads, but of course they're still there if you want \"extra\" bonuses. After a few villages it becomes a real slog (on village 15), you cannot automate anything anymore as it's too expensive and it just becomes tedious. I spent £18 on this for no ads and a bonus pack, for the same price I could get a decent PC game that I could play for much longer, without the need to constantly spend to get further.

I still love it though 👻153 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMarisa Roymore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 25, 2024A fantastic story, as expected from Project Moon. Absolutely chock full of symbolism, meaningful questions about life, and political parallels. The gameplay is also great. However, between stories/events the game is pretty boring. I think there needs to be more content that isnt just 'hardcore' like refraction railway. Give us dailies or something.38 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKai Williamsmore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 16, 2024Believe me when I say it's a masterpiece. While mostly a story driven game with a narrative I could only describe as captivating, its gameplay is also deep and engaging. Anyone who tells you this game is \"easy\" is a liar or doesn't understand the meaning of the word. You cannot \"auto\" your way through this game, as it will frequently remind you to respect the enemies and their mechanics. This game deserves no less than a 10/10 for characters, story, music, and gameplay.

The game is fun upto certain point but beyond that it is just cash grab! The combat system is completely based on power which means if you have lower power rating than your opponent you lose. So constantly you have to level up your characters and resources to do so is scarce. The very concept of strategy is completely missing.

The game is great I would say. The graphics are good, nice character designs, amazing world building and also have cool concept. I like the storyline so far, even if the start is kinda cliche lol. My only problem is the gacha rate is really sucks and the pity too. You will need lots of resources to upgrade your characters and the energy is not enough. Friends function also kinda useless??

Unfortunately, the top rank promotion items are almost entirely bought not earned, so max level characters cost $50 US, each. Very stingy since that's the full price for a PC game and you're just levelling a character not even getting them. On the plus side, there is a lot to do, many different sub systems to explore, rewards for having a lot of mid tier characters etc. not bad.23 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSolid Clouds hf.January 17, 2025Thank you for your review, Gavin!

Your feedback is valuable as we refine the game. Join us on Discord: https://discord.com/invite/playfrontiers.Raithe Blackwolfmore_vert Flag inappropriateDecember 4, 2024Overall good game. Biggest negative is Battles are auto, you set formation but have zero control which is annoying for any battle game. Second is the game requires same connection or game disconnect and you lose the battle. You can't switch connection type, and for some reason if you are in a battle you have to be connected or you lose. Graphics are good. Events etc. are often. Good variety of characters and equipment. Essentially Raid shadow legends in space.45 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSolid Clouds hf.December 9, 2024Thank you for the great review Raithe.

It's a TD on the level I'd expect from NG a decade ago. The monetization tho... There are so many popups that they frequently block the UI. There's an ad play every minute or so. I got an ad for a limited offer half-price on a few characters! For $25. There are much better games I can pay that amount and just have the full game. There's a premium subscription that costs more than any AAA MMO ($20/month).

    "content": "Jump to Content\nJump to Content\nGoogle Play Terms of Service\nJuly 1, 2024\n          (View archived version)\n1. Introduction\nApplicable Terms. Thanks for using Google Play. Google Play is a service provided by Google LLC (“Google”, “we” or “us”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA. Your use of Google Play and the apps (including Android Instant Apps), system services, games, movies, books, magazines, or other digital content or services (referred to as \"Content\") available through it is subject to these Google Play Terms of Service (“Play ToS”) and the Google Terms of Service (\"Google ToS\") (together referred to as the “Terms”). Google Play is a “service” as described in the Google ToS. If there is any conflict between the Play ToS and the Google ToS, the Play ToS shall prevail.\n2. Your Use of Google Play\nAccess to and Use of Content. You may use Google Play to browse, locate, view, stream, or download Content for your mobile, computer, tv, watch, or other supported device (“Device”). To use Google Play, you will need a Device that meets the system and compatibility requirements for the relevant Content, working Internet access, and compatible software. The availability of Content and features will vary between countries and not all Content or features may be available in your country. Some Content may be available to share with family members. Content may be offered by Google or made available by third-parties not affiliated with Google. Google is not responsible for and does not endorse any Content made available through Google Play that originates from a source other than Google.\nAge Restrictions. In order to use Google Play, you must have a valid Google account (“Google Account”), subject to the following age restrictions. If you are considered a minor in your country, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use Google Play and to accept the Terms. You must comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Content or features on Google Play. Family managers and family members must meet these additional requirements as well.\nThird-Party Fees. You are responsible for any access or data fees incurred from third parties (such as your Internet provider or mobile carrier) in connection with your use and viewing of Content and Google Play.\nUpdates. Google Play, related support libraries, or Content may need to be updated, for example, for bug fixes, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, “Updates”). Such Updates may be necessary in order for you to use Google Play or to access, download, or use Content. By agreeing to these Terms and using Google Play, you agree to receive such Updates automatically. You may be able to manage Updates to certain Content via Settings in Google Play. If it is determined, however, that the Update will fix a critical security vulnerability or critical operability issue related to the Content, or will prevent abuse, the Update may be completed irrespective of your Update settings in Google Play or your Device. If another app store attempts to update Content that was initially downloaded from Google Play, you may receive a warning or such updates may be prevented entirely.\nInformation about You. Google’s Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when using Google Play. Google may need to provide your personal information, such as your name and email address, to Providers for the purposes of processing your transactions or provisioning Content to you. Providers agree to use this information in accordance with their privacy policies.\nIf you are part of a family group on Google Play, your family members in the family group will be able to see certain information about you. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google Play, family members you invite to join the family group will see your name, photo, and e-mail address. If you join a family group as a family member, other family members will be able to see your name, photo, and e-mail address. Your family manager may also see your age and will see a record of all purchases you make using the designated family payment method, including a description of the Content purchased. If Content is available for family sharing and you share it with your family group, then all family members will be able to access the Content and see that you purchased it.\nUnauthorized Access to Accounts. You must keep your account details secure and must not share them with anyone else. You must not collect or harvest any personal data of any user of Google Play or of any user of other Google Services via Google Play, including account names.\nDisabled Accounts. If Google disables access to your account in accordance with the Terms (for example if you violate the Terms), you may be prevented from accessing Google Play, your account details or any files or other Content that is stored with your account. See the Help Center for more information. If you are the family manager of a family on Google Play and Google disables access to your account, your family members may lose access to family features requiring a family group, such as a family payment method, family subscriptions, or Content shared by family members. If you are a family member of a family on Google Play and Google disables your account, your family members will lose access to Content you have shared with them.\nMalware protection. To protect you against malicious third party software, URLs, and other security issues, Google may receive information about your Device’s network connections, potentially harmful URLs, the operating system, and apps installed on your Device through Google Play or from other sources. Google may warn you if it considers an app or URL to be unsafe, or Google may remove or block its installation on your Device if it is known to be harmful to devices, data or users. You can choose to disable some of these protections in the settings on your Device, however, Google may continue to receive information about apps installed through Google Play, and apps installed on your Device from other sources may continue to be analyzed for security issues without sending information to Google.\nAndroid Instant Apps. When you click on a link on your Device, Google Play may check if an applicable instant app exists and, if so, open the link within the instant app. Any code needed to run the portions of the instant app you access will be downloaded to your Device and kept on it temporarily. App details for an instant app can be found in the Google Play store. Android Instant Apps data and settings are synced to devices signed in with your Google account. You can choose to disable Android Instant Apps in the settings on your Device.\nChanges to these Terms.If the Play ToS change, you will be given at least 30 days notice, and the new Play ToS will be effective after such notice period. Your continued use of Google Play following such notice period will indicate your acceptance of the new Play ToS. The new Play ToS will apply to your use of all Content (including Content you have installed or purchased in the past) and all subsequent installs or purchases. If you do not agree with such changes, you will be given the opportunity to download the Content you previously purchased or installed and terminate your use of the Google Play. You may continue to view that copy of the Content on your Devices in accordance with the last version of the Play ToS that you accepted.\n3. Purchases and Payments\nFree Content. Google may allow you to download, view or use Content free of charge on Google Play. Additional limitations may apply to your access and use of certain free Content.\nPurchase of Content. When you buy Content on or using Google Play you will enter into a separate sale contract based on these Terms (as applicable) with the seller which will be either:\n(a) Google Digital Inc. or\n(b) provider of the Content (the \"Provider\"), including where Google Digital Inc. is acting as an agent for the Provider.\nThe separate sale contract is in addition to these Terms.\nFor sales where Google is acting as an agent for the Provider, the statement, in the Google ToS, that the Google ToS “do not create any third party beneficiary rights”, does not apply to your use of Google Play.\nYour contract for the purchase and use of Content is completed once you receive the email from Google confirming your purchase of that Content, and performance of this contract begins as soon as the purchase is complete.\nPre-orders. When you place a pre-order for Content, your contract for the purchase and use of that item is completed when the Content is made available to you, and you will be charged for the purchase at that time. You can cancel your pre-order at any time up to the point at which the Content becomes available to you. We will need to cancel your pre-order if the Content is withdrawn from sale through Google Play before it is made available and we reserve the right to cancel your order in the event the price changes before your order is fulfilled.\nFamily Payment Method. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google Play, you will be required to set up a valid family payment method for your family members to use to purchase Content on Google Play and within apps. You will be responsible for all of your family members’ purchases of Content using the family payment method. If a family group is deleted, or a family member leaves the family group, you may be charged for pending purchases made by family members using the family payment method.\nGoogle Payments. In order to purchase Content through Google Play, you must have a Google Payments account and agree to the Google Payments Terms of Service.The Google Payments Privacy Notice applies whenever you purchase Content using a Google Payments account. You are responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases made through Google Play on your Google Payments account.\nOther Payment Processing Methods. Google may make available to you various payment processing methods in addition to Google Payments to facilitate the purchase of Content through Google Play. You must abide by any relevant terms and conditions or other legal agreement, whether with Google or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. Google may add or remove payment processing methods at its sole discretion. You are solely responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases you make on Google Play.\nEligibility for Carrier Billing. In order to determine your eligibility to have purchases of Content that you make through your Devices billed to your network provider’s account, when you create a Google Play account on a Device, we will send identifiers of your Device, e.g., subscriber ID and SIM card serial number, to your network provider. To permit this you will need to accept the network provider’s terms of service. The network provider may send us your billing address information. We will hold and use this information in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policies and Google Payments Privacy Notice.\nPricing. Pricing and availability of all Content displayed through Google Play are subject to change at any time prior to purchase.\nTaxes.\"Taxes\" means any duties, customs fees, levies or taxes (other than income tax) associated with the sale of Content, including any related penalties or interest. You are responsible for any Taxes and must pay for Content without any reduction for Taxes. If the seller of Content or Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be charged to you. You must comply with any and all applicable tax laws, including the reporting and payment of any Taxes arising in connection with your use of Google Play or the purchase of Content on or through Google Play. The reporting and payment of any such applicable Taxes are your responsibility.\nAll Sales Final. See Google Play’s Refund Policy for more information about your rights to withdraw, cancel, or return purchases for a refund. Except as expressly set out in the Google ToS, Google Play’s Refund Policy or the refund policies of the Provider, all sales are final, and no returns, replacements or refunds are permitted. If a replacement, return or refund is granted for any transaction, the transaction may be reversed, and you may no longer be able to access the Content that you acquired through that transaction.\nSubscriptions. Subscriptions are automatically charged each billing period (whether weekly, monthly, annually, or another period), and you may be charged no earlier than 24 hours before the beginning of each billing period.\n(a)Trials Periods. When you subscribe to Content for a price, you may receive access to the subscription benefits at no charge for a specified trial period, after which you will be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period. Once you cancel your trial, you will immediately lose access to the Content and any subscription privileges unless otherwise specified. Access to such trial periods may be limited to a certain number of trials for each user during a given period, or other restrictions.\n(b)Cancellations. You may cancel a subscription at any time before the end of the applicable billing period as described in the Help Center, and the cancellation will apply to the next period. For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription, you may cancel that subscription at any time during any month of the subscription, and the subscription will be cancelled at the end of your then-current billing period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period, except as otherwise provided in Google Play’s Refund Policy (for example where Content is defective).\n(c)Reductions for Print Subscribers. Some Providers of periodicals may allow you to purchase a subscription of periodical Content on Google Play at a reduced rate if you are already a print subscriber. If you cancel your print subscription of that periodical or your print subscription expires and you do not renew it, your reduced subscription rate of that Content on Google Play will be cancelled automatically.\n(d)Price Increases. When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, Google will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 30 days' prior notice before the charge is made. If you are given less than 30 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription as described in the Cancellations section of these Terms, and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. Where the Provider increases the price of a subscription and consent is required, Google may cancel your subscription unless you agree to the new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will be charged at the then current subscription rate.\n4. Rights and Restrictions\nLicense to Use Content. After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for Content, you will have the non-exclusive right, solely as expressly permitted in these Terms and associated policies, to store, access, view, use, and display copies of the applicable Content on your Devices or as otherwise authorized for your personal, non-commercial use only. All rights, title and interest in Google Play and Content not expressly granted to you in the Terms are reserved. Your use of apps and games may be governed by the additional terms and conditions of the end user license agreement between you and the Provider.\nViolation of License Terms. If you violate any of the Terms, your rights under this license will immediately terminate, and Google may terminate your access to Google Play, the Content or your Google Account without refund to you.\nRestrictions: You may not:\nThird-Party Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, the third parties who license their Content to Google are intended third party beneficiaries under these Terms solely with respect to the specific provisions of these Terms that directly concern their Content (“Third-Party Provisions”), and solely for the purpose of enabling such third parties to enforce their rights in such Content. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms confers a third-party beneficiary right upon any party, with respect to any provision that falls outside the Third Party Provisions, which includes but is not limited to any provisions or agreements incorporated by reference, or that may be referenced without incorporation, in these Terms.\nPlay Policies.Posting reviews on Google Play is subject to the following policies. If you want to report abuse or other content violations, click here.\nDefective Content. Once Content is available to you through your account, you should check the Content as soon as reasonably possible to ensure that it functions and performs as stated, and notify us or Provider as soon as reasonably possible if you find any errors or defect. See the Google Play Refund Policy for more information.\nRemoval or Unavailability of Content. Subject to the Terms, Content that you purchase or install will be available to you through Google Play for the period selected by you, in the case of a purchase for a rental period, and in other cases as long as Google has the right to make such Content available to you. In certain cases (for example if Google loses the relevant rights, a service or Content is discontinued, there are critical security issues, or there are breaches of applicable terms or the law), Google may remove from your Device or cease providing you with access to certain Content that you have purchased. For Content sold by Google Digital Inc. you may be given notice of any such removal or cessation, when possible. If you are not able to download a copy of the Content before such removal or cessation, Google may offer you either (a) a replacement of the Content if possible or (b) a full or partial refund of the price of the Content. If Google issues you a refund, the refund shall be your sole remedy.\nMultiple Accounts. If you have multiple Google Accounts with different user names, in some cases you may transfer Content out of an account and into another account, provided you are the owner of each such account and provided Google has enabled a feature of the relevant service allowing such transfers.\nLimits on access on Devices. Google may from time to time place limits on the number of Devices or software applications you may use to access Content. Please visit the Google Play Movies & TV/Google TV Usages Rules for more information about these limits for Google Play Movies & TV/Google TV.\nDangerous Activities. None of the Services or Content are intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, life support systems, emergency communications, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or any other such activities in which case the failure of the Services or Content could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\nGoogle Play Movies & TV/Google TV.

In its initial avatar, myScheme aims to offer a one-stop search and discovery portal where a user can find schemes that she is eligible for.The Search and Discovery scheme portal will reduce the time and effort of users by doing away with the requirement of searching multiple websites of government departments, and studying multiple scheme guidelines to check for their eligibility.Government Schemes are classified into different categories so that citizens can choose the specific category to search for schemes like Education & Learning, Health & Wellness, Housing & Shelter, and many more. Also, there is a facility to check your eligibility for schemes and then you can easily apply for the best-suited Government Scheme to get benefits. It is a very easy process to just search, check eligibility, and apply. myScheme initiated this service for common people to make searching easy and get benefits from Government Scheme.Updated onOct 23, 2024Productivity\nAbout this app\nData safetyarrow_forwardSafety starts with understanding how developers collect and share your data.

But, The translation part for voice recordings is messed up. Everytime, I press the mic button for recording. It says to hold and when I hold the all gets closed and even cleared from stateful state and restarts. A huge bug. Great initiative, Looking forward to more languages and Beta languages like Sanskrit getting shifted to general.248 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoElvis Francismore_vert Flag inappropriateSeptember 7, 2023The app response is a bit slow for the live conversation experience. After recording for the full duration, the translation was not completed and the recording and translation disappeared. It would also help to have a button to swap languages. Also a small history of recent translations needs to be kept for referencing purposes. This needs more work..143 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSONAL SHARMAmore_vert Flag inappropriateDecember 15, 2023This app is really helpful and had a very good sense of words and sentences , the 2 problems or I can say 2 suggestions to the developer one is to add the history so that we can see our previous translations and another is for a save option so that we can save new words for further reference .

The current system of monitoring of illegal coal mining is based on local complaints and inputs based on unreliable sources. There is no robust mechanism to monitor the action taken on such complaintsAbout CMSMSThe CMSS is a satellite based monitoring system which can provide trigger for any coal mining like activity in the vicinity of the existing coal mining areas.Developed under the Digital India Programme, CMSMS is one of the first of such surveillance system developed in the country using spatial technology.CMSMS has been hosted on the National Centre of Geo-Informatics (NCoG) portal https://ncog.gov.in/CMSS/loginThe system aims to establish a regime of responsive coal mining administration by curbing instances of illegal coal mining activity through remote sensing and detection technologyThe system provide tool to public for reporting through “Khan Prahari” mobile applicationThe advantages of remote sensing technology based monitoring system areTransparency : Public will be provided an access to the systemBias-free and Independent : The system is based on satellite dataDeterrence effect : Eyes watching from the skyQuicker response: The coal mining areas will be monitored regularly. Effective Follow-up: The actions taken on triggers will be followed up at various levels like district mining offices, coal production headquarters, Offices of CMPDI and Ministry of Coal, GoI.How CMSMS works:The Maps of the coal blocks and coalfield boundaries have been geo-referenced.The geo-referenced coal blocks and coalfield boundaries are superimposed on the latest satellite remote sensing images. The system can scan a region of 100 meters around the existing coalfield boundary to identify any unusual activity which is likely to be illegal coal mining. Any such ground signature identified will be treated as a suspicious activity and a trigger will be generated with a reference number.These triggers will be studied by specialist groups identified by MoC, and then transmitted to the concerned nodal officials for field verification. A check for illegality in operation is conducted and reported back to the system and can be traced against the reference number initially assigned to it..A user-friendly mobile app (Khan Prahari) Mobile Applications has been developed, which is a part of the system, for reporting any illegal coal mining incident through geotagged photographs as well as textual information by any individual.The mobile app Khan Prahari, also aims to establish a participative monitoring system where the citizens also can use this app and report any unusual or illegal coal mining activity.

When I asked it to derive a formula, then with the formula it gave a text information about the formula in a bracket but the problem is that the text doesn't have any space. Like it writes (Thenegativesigndepends) instead of (The negative sign depends). This makes it a little inconvenient and problematic sometimes. One more thing it should have a \"read out loud\" feature.

The thing that drops my rating dramatically is the useless junk filter. I even emailed customer support and they said it was based on my web history. Well I call BS because I don't look for metal roofs nor ozempic. At times the junk mail stops but then it just comes back with a vengeance. Like it doesn't even have a spam filter.

This app is perfect! Just perfect, because you have all the features that the other apps are actually charging for and it's absolutely free over here. Also I went out for Microsoft, Google & Adobe as well but none of them could prove this perfect. I highly recommend this app and my students also have started using it. The best part, absolutely easy interface.

I performed a thorough comparison between adobe scan, cam scanner and this app. This app trumps both of them. The feature i liked the most is the brush tool which allows you to manually remove stray marks if any. The color filters are also quite good.... but would like to point that there is not much difference between the first two color filters , sharp black and ocv black... would be better if the difference looks more prominent.424 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoLUFICK TECHNOLOGY PRIVATE LIMITEDApril 16, 2024Thanks for your kind feedback.

Most of all, I like that when they implemented AI they let you opt out without any fuss. Not everyone needs or wants it and you can easily disable it in the settings, it's not forced.1,757 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s new25.4.1NEW:  SAVE WEBPAGES AS PDFs  Paid subscribers can now convert any webpage to a PDF in seconds.

It used to be good. Now it changed the input box to one line only. It becomes very difficult to navigate to a long sentences, especially if we need to go back to the first word and back to the last word. It also very hard to correct typo or check the typo. It reduces visibility significantly and very cumbersome to navigate. My suggestion, at least it should have 5 or 6 lines input box.

Then it sets up a nice table on summary at the end with final notes and suggested next questions..

Persistent and wildly inaccurate autocorrect, completely random capitalization in the middle of typing a sentence/word, and worst of all, deleting anything usually results in odd phantom words or segments of previously deleted text returning.15 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoGoogle LLCApril 28, 2025Hi Barry!

The undo button is no longer available and swiping up, which is supposed to be the way to undo entries, does not work for me... As a result, I lost a note that was several years old in which I make daily entries. Not good!!13 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAman Alimore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 11, 2025Samsung Notes is a super handy app for anyone who needs to jot down quick ideas, make to-do lists, or even take detailed notes for work or study. I really like how smooth and easy the interface is. It supports handwriting, drawing, and typing – which makes it very flexible. You can also add images and even PDFs. One of my favorite features is the sync with Samsung Cloud, so I can access my notes across different devices. Definitely recommend giving it a try!20 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMike Shaunessymore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyApril 2, 2025Over the years, this is at least the 3rd generation (that I remember, maybe more) of Notes. Each year, more complicated and worse, and this year, no more import old version notes. And what will import sucks. Stop reinventing the wheel Samsung!!! 😔 ---------UPDATE 4/2/25: Love Samsung Notes. Use often. App format has not changed over recent years and is a lot easier to use now. Drawings and lists made with my stylus are perfect. I dont know of any other cell phone that would offer this function.219 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s new• Supports Android V-OS• Supports One UI 7.0• Fixed bugs\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_moreemailSupport emailnoreply.sec@samsung.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer 삼성전자(주)  mobile.biz@samsung.com  대한민국 16677 경기도 수원시\n영통구 삼성로 129 (매탄동)  +82 1588-3366\nApp support\nMore by Samsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.arrow_forwardSamsung Smart Switch MobileSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.1starSamsung CalculatorSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.5starSmartThingsSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.5starSamsung Internet BrowserSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.1starSamsung HealthSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.2starSamsung MusicSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.5star\nMore by Samsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.\nSimilar appsarrow_forwardSamsung MembersSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.4starSamsung Global GoalsSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.1starVoice RecorderSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.3starSamsung EmailSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.5starClockSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.3starSamsung CalendarSamsung Electronics Co.,  Ltd.4.3star\nSimilar apps\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

Well, at least if you wanted the original date to stay the same, which could be an option.

I thank the developers for creating quite possibly the WORST cloud storage app. I didn't use it for anything other than downloading some files. My data was being consumed at an alarming rate(which is fine) but when I looked at the download speed in the app it was at half of what was being consumed. I only used this app cause there were no alternative download option for my files.

On the few occasions I forgot to turn my ad block on there were multiple very questionable ads (your phone is infected etc). I only use it as a viewer and, if you block ads, it gets the job done. I wish it had a single payment option for viewer only features. I just can't justify paying a subscription for a full set of features I'll never use.10 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoDavid Torresmore_vert Flag inappropriateMarch 12, 2025Mute the adds, it's unprofessional...

Great app for wireless printing, it adds more features such as Document quality, fit to page, fill page, double sided printing etc. over the default Android printing service. Good and Fast. The problem is that in automatic quality, the printer always prints at the best quality, which is not needed, due to which it takes ink more fast. Othervise, a good app.57 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoBri Evamore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 5, 2025it is a nice simple app. maybe a bit to simple as it is missing a major option. you are not able to put more than one photo on any piece of paper. to be able to put 4 or more photos on an A4 sheet for example would be a great addition. don't know why this is not possible, seems like a major flaw with this app. should not have to install third party apps to be able to do this. come on HP, time for an app update don't you think?2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoNancy B.

Features:* simple interface that most of the users find easy to use* no limits on note's length or number of notes (of course there's a limit to phone's storage)* creating and editing text notes* importing notes from txt files, saving notes as txt files* sharing notes with other apps (e.g. sending a note by email)* notes widget allowing to quickly create or edit notes, working like post it notes (stick a memo to home screen)* backup function for saving and loading notes from a backup file (zip file)* app password lock* color themes (including dark theme)* note categories* automatic note saving* undo/redo changes in notes* lines in background, numbered lines in a note* technical support* search function that can quickly find text in notes* unlock app with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint or face recognition)It may be obvious, but notes in the app can be used in many ways. For example as a to do list to increase productivity. A sort of digital planner to store shopping list or to organize the day. Notes can be put on the home screen as reminders. Each task could be stored in a seperate note or one big todo note could be used.** Important **Please remember to make a backup copy of notes before formatting a phone or buying a new phone. Since the 1.7.0 version the app will also use phone's device copy, if it's turned on in the device's and the app's settings.* Why do I advise to not install the app on an SD card?I follow the official advice to block installing on an SD card apps that use widgets. This app uses widgets, which are like icons for the notes, and can be placed on a phone's home screen (for example).If you have any additional questions, just contact me by email: notepad.free@outlook.com .Thank you.ArekUpdated onMar 28, 2025Productivity\nAbout this app\nData safetyarrow_forwardSafety starts with understanding how developers collect and share your data.

If that sounds good, please post on our online Community https://www.dropboxforum.com/, or contact our team on X at @DropboxSupport or Facebook at facebook.com/Dropbox, so we can gather more information. Thanks!John Khudang Limbumore_vert Flag inappropriateDecember 20, 2024I've been using Dropbox for a while now, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its seamless file-sharing and storage capabilities! The app is user-friendly, and the syncing process is incredibly fast. One feature I'd love to see implemented is two-step verification (2SV) directly within the app. Adding this extra layer of security would provide even more peace of mind for users like me who store sensitive files. Keep up the fantastic work, Dropbox team!216 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMonish Mondalmore_vert Flag inappropriateOctober 27, 2024Undoubtedly, this app is one of the best in its free segment, being both reliable and secure. However, a major flaw lies in its poor design. While the web version is excellent, the Android app leaves much to be desired. It’s difficult to find the delete option, as you have to navigate to the settings to permanently remove items, which is quite annoying. Additionally, I recommend removing recently accessed files from the homepage, as it complicates finding other items.247 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newWhat’s new?• You can now easily share and star your photos and files with one click in the preview screen.We release updates regularly and are always looking for ways to make the app better.

User Interface: The first thing I noticed was the clean and intuitive interface. Navigating through documents is a breeze, and the toolbar is well-organized, allowing quick access to essential features without any clutter. The layout is visually appealing and easy on the eyes, making long reading sessions comfortable.1,282 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKushagra Vinidhmore_vert Flag inappropriateJanuary 11, 2024This is the best app I've ever came across. The UI is much easy to use. The features provided in this app is equivalent to most of the paid apps but there are also a few drawbacks like while selecting texts of a paragraph of one side it automatcally selects paragraphs on both the sides of the page. This is very disappointing. I would hope that the developers would resolve this issue ASAP.2,739 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSimple Design Ltd.January 12, 2024Hi Kushagra, sorry for the inconvenience.

    "content": "Sign in to get personalized Help and resolve your issues quicker.\nUnderstand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety sectionBefore you install an app from Google Play, you can check the app's Data safety section. Developers use the Data safety section to share information about how their app handles your data. This way, you can make more informed decisions about what apps you use.\n\n\n\n\nFor this same video with audio descriptions: Understand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety section.\n\n  Computer Android   More  MoreMore           Find an app’s data safety information\n\n\n  Go to play.google.com.\n  Browse or use the search bar to find an app.\n  Select an app.\n  Under \"Data safety,\" you’ll find a summary of the app’s data safety practices.\n  For more detail, select See details.\n\n\nTip: The info in the Data safety section only applies to apps distributed on Google Play. You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\n\n\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\n\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\n\n\n  Data collection: Developers describe the types of user data their app collects, how they use this data, and whether the collection of this data is optional. Data is generally considered “collected” when the developer uses their app to retrieve data off your device.\n\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"collected\" even if the data technically leaves your device (for example, when the data is only processed ephemerally). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n  Data sharing: Developers describe if their app shares your data with third parties and what types of data are shared. Data is generally considered \"shared\" when it is accessed by the app and transferred to a third party.\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"shared\" even if it's technically transferred to another party (for example, when you give your consent to transfer the data after the app explains how it will use the data, or when the data is shared with a developer’s service provider). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n\n\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\n\n\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nData collection\n\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\n\n\n  An app accesses the data only on your device and it is not sent off your device. For example, if you provide an app permission to access your location, but it only uses that data to provide app functionality on your device and does not send it to its server, it does not need to disclose that data as collected.\n  Your data is sent off the device but only processed ephemerally. This means the developer accesses and uses your data only when it is stored in memory, and retains the data for no longer than necessary to service a specific request. For example, if a weather app sends your location off your device to get the current weather at your location, but the app only uses your location data in memory and does not store the data for longer than necessary to provide the weather.\n  Your data is sent using end-to-end encryption. This means the data is unreadable by anyone other than the sender and recipient. For example, if you send a message to a friend using a messaging app with end-to-end encryption, only you and your friend can read the message.\n\n\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\n\n\n  The app does not access this information, and\n  You provide this information directly to the other service under that service’s privacy policy and terms of service.\n\n\nData sharing\n\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\n\n\n  The data is transferred to a third party based on a specific action that you initiate, where you reasonably expect the data to be shared. For example, when you send an email to or share a document with another person.\n  The data transfer to a third party is prominently disclosed in the app, and the app requests your consent in a way that meets the requirements of Google Play’s User Data policy.\n  The data is transferred to a service provider to process it on the developer’s behalf. For example, a developer may use a service provider to host data on their behalf and in compliance with the developer's instructions, contractual terms, privacy policies, and security standards.\n  The data is transferred for specific legal purposes, such as in response to a government request.\n  The data transferred is fully anonymized so it can no longer be associated with any individual.\n\n\n\nOther information in the Data safety section\nSecurity practices\n\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\n\n\n  Encrypts data that it collects or shares while it’s in transit.\n\n    \n      Some apps are designed to let you transfer your data to another site or service. These apps may declare in their Data safety section that your data is transferred over a secure connection as long as they use best industry standards to safely encrypt your data while it travels between your device and the app’s servers. The sites or services that you choose to have your data transferred to may have different privacy and security practices. Review those practices independently to ensure that you are transferring your data to secure destinations. For example, a messaging app that declares that it encrypts your data in transit may give you an option to send an SMS message through your mobile services provider. You should review the data handling practices of your mobile services provider, as it may not be using encryption in transit to securely send SMS messages over its mobile network.\n    \n  \n  Has been independently reviewed against a global security standard. This independent review validates the app’s security practices against a global standard. The third-party organizations performing the review are doing so on the developers' behalf. This review does not verify the accuracy and completeness of the developer’s Data safety section disclosure.\n  Offers payments through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is an instant money transfer system. It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an RBI-regulated entity. Developers indicate that NPCI has verified and validated this app's implementation of UPI. This security practice is only available for app use in India.\n\n\nData deletion\n\n\n  The Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\n\n  Some apps may offer you the ability to create an account. Apps that offer account creation must:\n\n  \n    Provide users with an in-app path to delete their app accounts and associated data.\n    Provide a web link resource where users can request app account deletion and associated data deletion.\n  \n\n  Some apps that offer account creation may also offer you the option to delete certain app data without deleting your entire account.\n\n  Other apps don’t offer account creation, but may provide a way for you to delete your associated data. To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\n\n  \n    Review the app's privacy policy.\n    Contact the developer.\n  \n  Learn more about Google Play's account deletion requirement for apps.\nOther app and data disclosures\n\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\n\nAccount management\n\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\n\nSystem services\n\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\n\n\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\n\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\n\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\n\nData types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Data type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Location\n      Approximate location\n      \n      Yours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\n      \n    \n    \n      Precise location\n      Yours or your device's physical location within an area less than 3 square kilometers.\n    \n    \n      Personal info\n      Name\n      \n      How you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\n      \n    \n    \n      Email address\n      Your email address.\n    \n    \n      User IDs\n      Identifiers that relate to an identifiable person.

This list includes:\n\n  \n    Data or features required for the app to work, like mobile network access\n    Data the app requests while you use it, like access to your camera\n  \n\n  This list is based on technical information that describes how the developer’s app works. It’s different from the Data safety section, which is based on information declared by app developers about how they collect, share, and handle your data.\n\n  Sometimes, the information in the app permissions list may be different from what's in the Data safety section. Some of the possible reasons for this include:\n\n  \n    The app accesses data to process it on the device, but doesn’t collect or share it.\n    The app collects data in a way that’s not managed by permissions.\n    The service or data type in the permissions list isn’t covered in the Data safety section.\n  \n\nControl app permissions & data collection after download\n\n\n  After you download an app, the app must ask for permission to access certain data. If an app collects data you don’t want to share, you can:\n\n\n  Change your app permissions for a single app or by permission type in your phone's settings.\n  Let your phone automatically remove permissions for unused apps.\n  Delete apps to stop future data collection.\n\n\nTip: If you can’t request that your data be deleted from within the app, you can contact the developer to delete any data collected by the app. Learn how to contact an Android app's developer.\n\n\n\nGoogle Play \"Verified\" badge for apps that handle sensitive user data\n\nImportant: The list of criteria isn’t exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge.\n\nTo highlight developers who are transparent about their security and user privacy practices in the Data safety section, Google Play introduces the \"Verified\" badge. When awarded, the new badge is prominently displayed on the app’s details page and in search results. Currently, this badge is only available for VPN apps. To be considered for the \"Verified\" badge, the app must meet certain criteria:\n\n\n  Follow Play safety and security guidelines.\n  Complete a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation.\n  Publish on Google Play for at least 90 days.\n  Achieve at least 10,000 installs and 250 reviews.\n  Have an Organization developer account type.\n  Meet target API level requirements for Google Play apps.\n  Submit Data safety section declaration, which includes declaring or opting into:\n    \n      Independent security review\n      Encryption in transit\n    \n  \n\n\nRelated resources\n\n\n  How Google helps protect you from harmful apps & malware\n  Change app permissions on your Android phone\n\n\n  \n  \n\nGive feedback about this article\n  \n  \n\nChoose a section to give feedback on                           Need more help?

Developers use the Data safety section to share information about how their app handles your data. This way, you can make more informed decisions about what apps you use.\n\n\n\n\nFor this same video with audio descriptions: Understand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety section.\n\n  Computer Android   More  MoreMore           Find an app’s data safety information\n\n\n  Go to play.google.com.\n  Browse or use the search bar to find an app.\n  Select an app.\n  Under \"Data safety,\" you’ll find a summary of the app’s data safety practices.\n  For more detail, select See details.\n\n\nTip: The info in the Data safety section only applies to apps distributed on Google Play. You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\n\n\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\n\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\n\n\n  Data collection: Developers describe the types of user data their app collects, how they use this data, and whether the collection of this data is optional. Data is generally considered “collected” when the developer uses their app to retrieve data off your device.\n\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"collected\" even if the data technically leaves your device (for example, when the data is only processed ephemerally). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n  Data sharing: Developers describe if their app shares your data with third parties and what types of data are shared. Data is generally considered \"shared\" when it is accessed by the app and transferred to a third party.\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"shared\" even if it's technically transferred to another party (for example, when you give your consent to transfer the data after the app explains how it will use the data, or when the data is shared with a developer’s service provider). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n\n\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\n\n\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nData collection\n\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\n\n\n  An app accesses the data only on your device and it is not sent off your device. For example, if you provide an app permission to access your location, but it only uses that data to provide app functionality on your device and does not send it to its server, it does not need to disclose that data as collected.\n  Your data is sent off the device but only processed ephemerally. This means the developer accesses and uses your data only when it is stored in memory, and retains the data for no longer than necessary to service a specific request. For example, if a weather app sends your location off your device to get the current weather at your location, but the app only uses your location data in memory and does not store the data for longer than necessary to provide the weather.\n  Your data is sent using end-to-end encryption. This means the data is unreadable by anyone other than the sender and recipient. For example, if you send a message to a friend using a messaging app with end-to-end encryption, only you and your friend can read the message.\n\n\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\n\n\n  The app does not access this information, and\n  You provide this information directly to the other service under that service’s privacy policy and terms of service.\n\n\nData sharing\n\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\n\n\n  The data is transferred to a third party based on a specific action that you initiate, where you reasonably expect the data to be shared. For example, when you send an email to or share a document with another person.\n  The data transfer to a third party is prominently disclosed in the app, and the app requests your consent in a way that meets the requirements of Google Play’s User Data policy.\n  The data is transferred to a service provider to process it on the developer’s behalf. For example, a developer may use a service provider to host data on their behalf and in compliance with the developer's instructions, contractual terms, privacy policies, and security standards.\n  The data is transferred for specific legal purposes, such as in response to a government request.\n  The data transferred is fully anonymized so it can no longer be associated with any individual.\n\n\n\nOther information in the Data safety section\nSecurity practices\n\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\n\n\n  Encrypts data that it collects or shares while it’s in transit.\n\n    \n      Some apps are designed to let you transfer your data to another site or service. These apps may declare in their Data safety section that your data is transferred over a secure connection as long as they use best industry standards to safely encrypt your data while it travels between your device and the app’s servers. The sites or services that you choose to have your data transferred to may have different privacy and security practices. Review those practices independently to ensure that you are transferring your data to secure destinations. For example, a messaging app that declares that it encrypts your data in transit may give you an option to send an SMS message through your mobile services provider. You should review the data handling practices of your mobile services provider, as it may not be using encryption in transit to securely send SMS messages over its mobile network.\n    \n  \n  Has been independently reviewed against a global security standard. This independent review validates the app’s security practices against a global standard. The third-party organizations performing the review are doing so on the developers' behalf. This review does not verify the accuracy and completeness of the developer’s Data safety section disclosure.\n  Offers payments through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is an instant money transfer system. It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an RBI-regulated entity. Developers indicate that NPCI has verified and validated this app's implementation of UPI. This security practice is only available for app use in India.\n\n\nData deletion\n\n\n  The Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\n\n  Some apps may offer you the ability to create an account. Apps that offer account creation must:\n\n  \n    Provide users with an in-app path to delete their app accounts and associated data.\n    Provide a web link resource where users can request app account deletion and associated data deletion.\n  \n\n  Some apps that offer account creation may also offer you the option to delete certain app data without deleting your entire account.\n\n  Other apps don’t offer account creation, but may provide a way for you to delete your associated data. To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\n\n  \n    Review the app's privacy policy.\n    Contact the developer.\n  \n  Learn more about Google Play's account deletion requirement for apps.\nOther app and data disclosures\n\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\n\nAccount management\n\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\n\nSystem services\n\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\n\n\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\n\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\n\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\n\nData types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Data type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Location\n      Approximate location\n      \n      Yours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\n      \n    \n    \n      Precise location\n      Yours or your device's physical location within an area less than 3 square kilometers.\n    \n    \n      Personal info\n      Name\n      \n      How you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\n      \n    \n    \n      Email address\n      Your email address.\n    \n    \n      User IDs\n      Identifiers that relate to an identifiable person.

This list includes:\n\n  \n    Data or features required for the app to work, like mobile network access\n    Data the app requests while you use it, like access to your camera\n  \n\n  This list is based on technical information that describes how the developer’s app works. It’s different from the Data safety section, which is based on information declared by app developers about how they collect, share, and handle your data.\n\n  Sometimes, the information in the app permissions list may be different from what's in the Data safety section. Some of the possible reasons for this include:\n\n  \n    The app accesses data to process it on the device, but doesn’t collect or share it.\n    The app collects data in a way that’s not managed by permissions.\n    The service or data type in the permissions list isn’t covered in the Data safety section.\n  \n\nControl app permissions & data collection after download\n\n\n  After you download an app, the app must ask for permission to access certain data. If an app collects data you don’t want to share, you can:\n\n\n  Change your app permissions for a single app or by permission type in your phone's settings.\n  Let your phone automatically remove permissions for unused apps.\n  Delete apps to stop future data collection.\n\n\nTip: If you can’t request that your data be deleted from within the app, you can contact the developer to delete any data collected by the app. Learn how to contact an Android app's developer.\n\n\n\nGoogle Play \"Verified\" badge for apps that handle sensitive user data\n\nImportant: The list of criteria isn’t exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge.\n\nTo highlight developers who are transparent about their security and user privacy practices in the Data safety section, Google Play introduces the \"Verified\" badge. When awarded, the new badge is prominently displayed on the app’s details page and in search results. Currently, this badge is only available for VPN apps. To be considered for the \"Verified\" badge, the app must meet certain criteria:\n\n\n  Follow Play safety and security guidelines.\n  Complete a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation.\n  Publish on Google Play for at least 90 days.\n  Achieve at least 10,000 installs and 250 reviews.\n  Have an Organization developer account type.\n  Meet target API level requirements for Google Play apps.\n  Submit Data safety section declaration, which includes declaring or opting into:\n    \n      Independent security review\n      Encryption in transit\n    \n  \n\n\nRelated resources\n\n\n  How Google helps protect you from harmful apps & malware\n  Change app permissions on your Android phone\n\n\n  \n  \n\nGive feedback about this article\n  \n  \n\nChoose a section to give feedback on\nUnderstand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety sectionBefore you install an app from Google Play, you can check the app's Data safety section. Developers use the Data safety section to share information about how their app handles your data. This way, you can make more informed decisions about what apps you use.\n\n\n\n\nFor this same video with audio descriptions: Understand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety section.\n\n  Computer Android   More  MoreMore           Find an app’s data safety information\n\n\n  Go to play.google.com.\n  Browse or use the search bar to find an app.\n  Select an app.\n  Under \"Data safety,\" you’ll find a summary of the app’s data safety practices.\n  For more detail, select See details.\n\n\nTip: The info in the Data safety section only applies to apps distributed on Google Play. You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\n\n\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\n\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\n\n\n  Data collection: Developers describe the types of user data their app collects, how they use this data, and whether the collection of this data is optional. Data is generally considered “collected” when the developer uses their app to retrieve data off your device.\n\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"collected\" even if the data technically leaves your device (for example, when the data is only processed ephemerally). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n  Data sharing: Developers describe if their app shares your data with third parties and what types of data are shared. Data is generally considered \"shared\" when it is accessed by the app and transferred to a third party.\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"shared\" even if it's technically transferred to another party (for example, when you give your consent to transfer the data after the app explains how it will use the data, or when the data is shared with a developer’s service provider). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n\n\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\n\n\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nData collection\n\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\n\n\n  An app accesses the data only on your device and it is not sent off your device. For example, if you provide an app permission to access your location, but it only uses that data to provide app functionality on your device and does not send it to its server, it does not need to disclose that data as collected.\n  Your data is sent off the device but only processed ephemerally. This means the developer accesses and uses your data only when it is stored in memory, and retains the data for no longer than necessary to service a specific request. For example, if a weather app sends your location off your device to get the current weather at your location, but the app only uses your location data in memory and does not store the data for longer than necessary to provide the weather.\n  Your data is sent using end-to-end encryption. This means the data is unreadable by anyone other than the sender and recipient. For example, if you send a message to a friend using a messaging app with end-to-end encryption, only you and your friend can read the message.\n\n\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\n\n\n  The app does not access this information, and\n  You provide this information directly to the other service under that service’s privacy policy and terms of service.\n\n\nData sharing\n\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\n\n\n  The data is transferred to a third party based on a specific action that you initiate, where you reasonably expect the data to be shared. For example, when you send an email to or share a document with another person.\n  The data transfer to a third party is prominently disclosed in the app, and the app requests your consent in a way that meets the requirements of Google Play’s User Data policy.\n  The data is transferred to a service provider to process it on the developer’s behalf. For example, a developer may use a service provider to host data on their behalf and in compliance with the developer's instructions, contractual terms, privacy policies, and security standards.\n  The data is transferred for specific legal purposes, such as in response to a government request.\n  The data transferred is fully anonymized so it can no longer be associated with any individual.\n\n\n\nOther information in the Data safety section\nSecurity practices\n\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\n\n\n  Encrypts data that it collects or shares while it’s in transit.\n\n    \n      Some apps are designed to let you transfer your data to another site or service. These apps may declare in their Data safety section that your data is transferred over a secure connection as long as they use best industry standards to safely encrypt your data while it travels between your device and the app’s servers. The sites or services that you choose to have your data transferred to may have different privacy and security practices. Review those practices independently to ensure that you are transferring your data to secure destinations. For example, a messaging app that declares that it encrypts your data in transit may give you an option to send an SMS message through your mobile services provider. You should review the data handling practices of your mobile services provider, as it may not be using encryption in transit to securely send SMS messages over its mobile network.\n    \n  \n  Has been independently reviewed against a global security standard. This independent review validates the app’s security practices against a global standard. The third-party organizations performing the review are doing so on the developers' behalf. This review does not verify the accuracy and completeness of the developer’s Data safety section disclosure.\n  Offers payments through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is an instant money transfer system. It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an RBI-regulated entity. Developers indicate that NPCI has verified and validated this app's implementation of UPI. This security practice is only available for app use in India.\n\n\nData deletion\n\n\n  The Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\n\n  Some apps may offer you the ability to create an account. Apps that offer account creation must:\n\n  \n    Provide users with an in-app path to delete their app accounts and associated data.\n    Provide a web link resource where users can request app account deletion and associated data deletion.\n  \n\n  Some apps that offer account creation may also offer you the option to delete certain app data without deleting your entire account.\n\n  Other apps don’t offer account creation, but may provide a way for you to delete your associated data. To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\n\n  \n    Review the app's privacy policy.\n    Contact the developer.\n  \n  Learn more about Google Play's account deletion requirement for apps.\nOther app and data disclosures\n\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\n\nAccount management\n\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\n\nSystem services\n\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\n\n\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\n\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\n\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\n\nData types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Data type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Location\n      Approximate location\n      \n      Yours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\n      \n    \n    \n      Precise location\n      Yours or your device's physical location within an area less than 3 square kilometers.\n    \n    \n      Personal info\n      Name\n      \n      How you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\n      \n    \n    \n      Email address\n      Your email address.\n    \n    \n      User IDs\n      Identifiers that relate to an identifiable person.

To be considered for the \"Verified\" badge, the app must meet certain criteria:\n\n\n  Follow Play safety and security guidelines.\n  Complete a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation.\n  Publish on Google Play for at least 90 days.\n  Achieve at least 10,000 installs and 250 reviews.\n  Have an Organization developer account type.\n  Meet target API level requirements for Google Play apps.\n  Submit Data safety section declaration, which includes declaring or opting into:\n    \n      Independent security review\n      Encryption in transit\n    \n  \n\n\nRelated resources\n\n\n  How Google helps protect you from harmful apps & malware\n  Change app permissions on your Android phone\n\n\n  \n  \n\nGive feedback about this article\n  \n  \n\nChoose a section to give feedback on\nUnderstand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety section\nBefore you install an app from Google Play, you can check the app's Data safety section. Developers use the Data safety section to share information about how their app handles your data. This way, you can make more informed decisions about what apps you use.\nFind an app’s data safety information\nTip: The info in the Data safety section only applies to apps distributed on Google Play. You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\nOther information in the Data safety section\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\nThe Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\nSome apps may offer you the ability to create an account. Apps that offer account creation must:\nSome apps that offer account creation may also offer you the option to delete certain app data without deleting your entire account.\nOther apps don’t offer account creation, but may provide a way for you to delete your associated data. To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\nAccount management\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\nSystem services\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\nYours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\nHow you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\nYour address, such as a mailing or home address.\nInformation about your race or ethnicity.\nInformation about your political or religious beliefs.\nInformation about your sexual orientation.\nAny other personal information such as date of birth, gender identity, veteran status, etc.\nInformation about your financial accounts, such as credit card number.\nInformation about purchases or transactions you have made.\nInformation about your credit.

This list includes:\nThis list is based on technical information that describes how the developer’s app works. It’s different from the Data safety section, which is based on information declared by app developers about how they collect, share, and handle your data.\nSometimes, the information in the app permissions list may be different from what's in the Data safety section. Some of the possible reasons for this include:\nAfter you download an app, the app must ask for permission to access certain data. If an app collects data you don’t want to share, you can:\nTip: If you can’t request that your data be deleted from within the app, you can contact the developer to delete any data collected by the app. Learn how to contact an Android app's developer.\nGoogle Play \"Verified\" badge for apps that handle sensitive user data\nImportant: The list of criteria isn’t exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge.\nTo highlight developers who are transparent about their security and user privacy practices in the Data safety section, Google Play introduces the \"Verified\" badge.

    "content": "Report Content On GoogleGoogle’s content and product policies apply wherever you are in the world, but we also have processes in place to remove or restrict access to content based on local laws. This page will help you get to the right place to report content that you would like removed from Google's services under Google’s policies or applicable laws.\n\nYou can also visit http://support.google.com for non-legal issues that concern Google’s Terms of Service or content and product policies. \n\nLegal standards vary greatly by country/region. Content that violates a specific law in one country/region may be legal in others. Typically, we remove or restrict access to the content only in the country/region where it is deemed to be illegal. When content is found to violate Google’s content or product policies or Terms of Service, however, we typically remove or restrict access globally.\n\nYou may report the same content through both legal and content/product policy reporting paths, but you must file each report separately. Note that reporting content through a content/product policy path does not substitute for reporting it through a legal path and does not serve as legal notice.\n\n \nSelect the Google product where the content you are reporting appears Note: You must submit a separate report for each Google product where the content appears Google Play Google Search Blogger/Blogspot Google Maps and related products Google Play YouTube A Google Ad Drive (Docs, Slides, Sheets, Forms, etc) Google Photos and Picasa Web Albums ShoppingSee more productsWhich product does your request relate to?

product policies apply wherever you are in the world, but we also have processes in place to remove or restrict access to content based on local laws. This page will help you get to the right place to report content that you would like removed from Google's services under Google’s policies or applicable laws.\nYou can also visit http://support.google.com for non-legal issues that concern Google’s Terms of Service or content and product policies.\nLegal standards vary greatly by country/region. Content that violates a specific law in one country/region may be legal in others. Typically, we remove or restrict access to the content only in the country/region where it is deemed to be illegal. When content is found to violate Google’s content or product policies or Terms of Service, however, we typically remove or restrict access globally.\nYou may report the same content through both legal and content/product policy reporting paths, but you must file each report separately. Note that reporting content through a content/product policy path does not substitute for reporting it through a legal path and does not serve as legal notice.\n"

    "content": "You can contact us via phone for policy issues anytime between 9am - 6pm on weekdays, except public holidays. Click on Contact us form to reach us.\nView and analyze your app's ratings and reviewsIn Play Console, you can see an overview of your app's ratings, individual user reviews, and clustered data about your app's reviews.\n\nUsers can rate your app on Google Play with a star rating and review. Users can only rate an app once, but they can update their rating or review at any time.\n\nTip: If you're a user looking for information on reviews that you've posted, go to the Google Play Help Center.\n\nRatings delay and pauses\n\nTo allow us to protect your app on Google Play and automatically detect suspicious ratings and reviews activity, we do not publicly post user reviews immediately, and new ratings do not immediately impact your published rating. Instead, new submissions are generally held back for around 24 hours. You can still see and reply to new reviews, even if they aren’t yet public. This allows you to continue to provide great customer service and quickly address any issues your users may be experiencing.\n\nIf suspicious activity is detected during the 24-hour delay period, all new ratings and reviews for your app will be held back from being published publicly while we investigate. Once complete, we will unpause and remove any ratings or reviews that were found to be abusive. Notifications and status indicators on the Ratings and Reviews pages will tell you if your app is paused, and the resolution of any investigation. They also show you if each review is public or not.\n\nBrowse ratings\nUsing the Play Console website\n\n\n  View your app's ratings data\n\n  \n    Open Play Console and go to the Ratings page (Ratings and reviews > Ratings).\n    Scroll the page to view the available ratings data, as described below.\n  \n\n  Note: Currently, the rating that users see on Google Play is weighted towards more recent ratings to reflect changes and updates that you make to your app.\n\n  Overview\n\n  At the top of the page, you’ll see an overview of your app’s ratings, which includes the following:\n\n  \n    Google Play rating: Your app rating shown to users on Google Play. This is calculated based on your most recent ratings.\n    Lifetime average rating: Your average rating from when you first launched your app.\n    Users: The total number of users who have rated your app. Note that users can update their rating at any time.\n    Total ratings: Number of ratings your app has received in its lifetime.\n      \n        Note: Total ratings is only available for apps that have received five or more ratings.\n      \n    \n    Rating vs. peers: How your app’s rating compares to a recommended set or a custom peer group that you select.\n  \n\n  Compare ratings to peers\n\n  Near the top of your app’s Ratings page, in the “Ratings vs. peers” card, select Edit peer group to create a custom peer group. After you create a custom peer group, you can see how your app compares with other apps on Google Play that you select.\n\n  On your app’s Ratings page and on any “Ratings breakdown” card, you can see how your app’s ratings compare with one of the apps in your custom peer group by hovering over any of the app icons displayed on a Ratings vs. peers card.\n\n  Performance over time\n\n  Under your app’s rating summary, you can view historical and detailed rating data. You can download the data in any chart you see using the Download CSV button. This allows you to analyze your data offline.\n\n  Use the date-range selector to choose what time period you want your data to cover. This covers a range from the last 28 days, to your app’s whole lifetime.\n\n  Use the period selector to choose how your data is aggregated: daily, every 7 days, or every 28 days.\n\n  Average rating shows your average rating over each period in your selected date range. You can choose if this average is just for the period (for instance the average rating for a given day), or your rolling lifetime average rating (your average total lifetime rating up to that day). Your peers’ median performance is displayed to help you compare your app’s quality.\n\n  Rating distribution shows the number of each rating that you received over each period in your selected date range. Change the selector to \"Percentages\" if you want to evaluate your normalized distribution, as opposed to absolute numbers received.\n\n  \n    Tip: by selecting \"Lifetime\" in the time date-range selector, and “Daily” in the period selector, you can use the Download CSV option in \"Ratings distribution\" to download data on all of the ratings that your app has ever received.\n  \n\n  Ratings breakdown\n\n  See how many ratings there are, and your average rating, across the following key dimensions:\n\n  \n    Country/region\n    Language\n    App version\n    Android version\n    Device type\n    Device model\n    Operator\n  \n\n  Select Explore on any \"Ratings breakdown\" card to see more information for that dimension, including how your app compares to other apps on Google Play.\n\n  \n    Average rating: Your app's rating for the selected time period, number of ratings, and breakdown type.\n    Number of ratings: The number of ratings submitted for your app for the selected time period and breakdown type.\n    Share of ratings: How the number of ratings per row compares to your app's total ratings.\n    Peers' median: The average rating for apps in the same Google Play category.\n    Vs. peers' median: How your app's rating compares to apps in the same Google Play category. For example, if your app's rating is 3.9 with a difference of +1.2, similar apps have a rating of 2.7.\n  \n\nUsing the Play Console app\n\n\n  \n    Open the Play Console app .\n    Select an app.\n    In the \"KPIs\" section, select Daily average rating KPI.\n  \n\n\nBrowse reviews\nUsing the Play Console website\n\n\n  See reviews for production apps\n\n  \n    Open Play Console and go to the Reviews page (Ratings and reviews > Reviews).\n    Decide how you want to browse reviews.\n      \n        Filter: To see reviews based on certain criteria (such as date, language, reply state, star rating, app version, device, and more), select from the available filters.\n        Sort: To see reviews based on rating, date, or helpfulness, select the \"Sort by\" dropdown.\n        Search: To look for specific words in your reviews, use the search box.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  See testing feedback\n\n  If you have an app in testing, you can access and reply to user feedback in Play Console. Beta feedback from users is only visible to you and can't be seen on Google Play.\n\n  \n    Open Play Console and go to the Testing feedback page (Ratings and reviews > Testing feedback).\n    Decide how you want to browse your feedback.\n      \n        Filter: To see beta feedback based on certain criteria (such as date, language, reply state, app version, device, and more), select from the available filters.\n        Search: To look for specific words in your feedback, use the search box.\n      \n    \n  \n\nUsing the Play Console app\n\n\n  \n    Open the Play Console app .\n    Select an app.\n    Go to the \"Reviews\" section.

To show all replies separately, click Hide history at the top of a review.\n    \n  \n\n  Note: Ratings and reviews include different versions of the same package. App ratings don't start over when you publish a new version of your app.\n\n\nAnalyze your reviews\n\nTo help you target the most impactful improvements to your app or game, you can view top trends and issues that users mention in your app's reviews. For tips on analyzing your reviews, visit the Android Developers site.\n\nTo see top trends and issues for your app, open Play Console and go to the Reviews analysis page.\n\nThe following features are available on the web version of Play Console.\nReview summaries: see common themes in your app's reviews\n\n\n  In the \"Review summaries\" section, you'll see the top positive and critical themes that surface regularly in reviews written in English. Summaries update regularly to let you know about the latest user experiences with your app.\n\n  We use machine learning algorithms to create summaries and apply filters to make sure only the most relevant reviews are included.\n\n  \n    For summaries to be available, your app needs to have enough similar reviews around more than one theme or topic.\n    Users may see representative summaries on your app's Google Play store listing in English.\n  \n\nBenchmarks: see how different topics impact your app rating\n\n\n  In the \"Benchmarks\" section, you can see how users review your app in relation to specific categories.

The line chart displays the change in volume over the length of time selected.\n    Effect on rating: Any red bars are bringing down your rating, and green bars are improving your rating. The width of the colored bar shows how much that topic impacts your overall rating.\n  \n\n  Peer benchmarks\n\n  In addition to the data for your app, benchmarks show how your app compares to others in the same Google Play category.\n\n  \n    Rating vs. peers: How your rating compares to apps in the same Google Play category. For example, if your app's rating for design is 3.9 with a benchmark difference of +1.2, similar apps have a rating of 2.7.\n    Number vs. peers: How the number of reviews per topic compares to apps in the same Google Play category. For example, if your app has 1,000 reviews for stability with a volume difference of 0.5x, similar apps have an average review volume of 2,000.\n  \n\nUpdated ratings: see how users update ratings and reviews over time\n\n\n  In the \"Updated Ratings\" section, you'll see how users have updated their ratings and reviews over the time period selected.\n\n  Types of updates from users\n\n  \n    With replies: In this row, you'll see data related to users who updated their rating or review after receiving a reply to their original review.\n    Without replies: In this row, you'll see data related to users who updated their rating or review without receiving a reply to their original review.\n  \n\n  Data points for your app\n\n  \n    Returning users: Number of users who returned to Google Play to update their original rating or review.\n    Updates to ratings: Upon returning to Google Play, the \"changes to ratings\" section shows whether users increased, decreased, or maintained their original rating.

Your use of Google Play is governed by the Google Play Business and Program Policies.\n\n  Follow these policies when commenting on user reviews:\n\n  \n    Make it clear and relevant: Replies should directly address the user's comment in a clear, valuable, and truthful manner. Try to address the user's comment within the text of your reply.\n    Be nice: These are your users and you want to help them find a resolution, not burn bridges. Do not post content that is abusive, hateful, dismissive, or threatens or harasses others. Also, don't engage inappropriate user comments through replies. Instead, read our posting guidelines for users and learn how to report inappropriate comments. You need to follow our posting policies regardless of the nature of the message you are replying to.\n    Don't solicit or promote: Users don't find solicitations and promotions relevant or useful.\n    Keep it clean: Don't post content that is sexually explicit or contains profanity.\n  \n\n  The use of this feature is a privilege, not a right. Failure to observe the above guidelines and any other Google Play terms may result in a suspension of your application or Google Play developer account as outlined in the Google Play terms.\n\nReport inappropriate reviews and comments\n\n\n  If you see a review or comment that doesn't follow the standards of our comment posting policy, go to report inappropriate reviews.\n\n\nSign up for review notifications\n\nTo receive email notifications when users write new reviews, update existing reviews, or submit new testing feedback, you can set up your notification preferences.\n\nTo learn more about email notifications, see Manage your developer account information.\n\nDownload reports from Google Cloud Storage\n\nYou can access and download reports as CSV files from Google Cloud Storage.

Users can only rate an app once, but they can update their rating or review at any time.\n\nTip: If you're a user looking for information on reviews that you've posted, go to the Google Play Help Center.\n\nRatings delay and pauses\n\nTo allow us to protect your app on Google Play and automatically detect suspicious ratings and reviews activity, we do not publicly post user reviews immediately, and new ratings do not immediately impact your published rating. Instead, new submissions are generally held back for around 24 hours. You can still see and reply to new reviews, even if they aren’t yet public. This allows you to continue to provide great customer service and quickly address any issues your users may be experiencing.\n\nIf suspicious activity is detected during the 24-hour delay period, all new ratings and reviews for your app will be held back from being published publicly while we investigate. Once complete, we will unpause and remove any ratings or reviews that were found to be abusive. Notifications and status indicators on the Ratings and Reviews pages will tell you if your app is paused, and the resolution of any investigation. They also show you if each review is public or not.\n\nBrowse ratings\nUsing the Play Console website\n\n\n  View your app's ratings data\n\n  \n    Open Play Console and go to the Ratings page (Ratings and reviews > Ratings).\n    Scroll the page to view the available ratings data, as described below.\n  \n\n  Note: Currently, the rating that users see on Google Play is weighted towards more recent ratings to reflect changes and updates that you make to your app.\n\n  Overview\n\n  At the top of the page, you’ll see an overview of your app’s ratings, which includes the following:\n\n  \n    Google Play rating: Your app rating shown to users on Google Play.

You can choose if this average is just for the period (for instance the average rating for a given day), or your rolling lifetime average rating (your average total lifetime rating up to that day). Your peers’ median performance is displayed to help you compare your app’s quality.\n\n  Rating distribution shows the number of each rating that you received over each period in your selected date range. Change the selector to \"Percentages\" if you want to evaluate your normalized distribution, as opposed to absolute numbers received.\n\n  \n    Tip: by selecting \"Lifetime\" in the time date-range selector, and “Daily” in the period selector, you can use the Download CSV option in \"Ratings distribution\" to download data on all of the ratings that your app has ever received.\n  \n\n  Ratings breakdown\n\n  See how many ratings there are, and your average rating, across the following key dimensions:\n\n  \n    Country/region\n    Language\n    App version\n    Android version\n    Device type\n    Device model\n    Operator\n  \n\n  Select Explore on any \"Ratings breakdown\" card to see more information for that dimension, including how your app compares to other apps on Google Play.\n\n  \n    Average rating: Your app's rating for the selected time period, number of ratings, and breakdown type.\n    Number of ratings: The number of ratings submitted for your app for the selected time period and breakdown type.\n    Share of ratings: How the number of ratings per row compares to your app's total ratings.\n    Peers' median: The average rating for apps in the same Google Play category.\n    Vs. peers' median: How your app's rating compares to apps in the same Google Play category.

Summaries update regularly to let you know about the latest user experiences with your app.\n\n  We use machine learning algorithms to create summaries and apply filters to make sure only the most relevant reviews are included.\n\n  \n    For summaries to be available, your app needs to have enough similar reviews around more than one theme or topic.\n    Users may see representative summaries on your app's Google Play store listing in English.\n  \n\nBenchmarks: see how different topics impact your app rating\n\n\n  In the \"Benchmarks\" section, you can see how users review your app in relation to specific categories. This can help you identify and understand trends in your app's reviews.

For example, if your app's rating for design is 3.9 with a benchmark difference of +1.2, similar apps have a rating of 2.7.\n    Number vs. peers: How the number of reviews per topic compares to apps in the same Google Play category. For example, if your app has 1,000 reviews for stability with a volume difference of 0.5x, similar apps have an average review volume of 2,000.\n  \n\nUpdated ratings: see how users update ratings and reviews over time\n\n\n  In the \"Updated Ratings\" section, you'll see how users have updated their ratings and reviews over the time period selected.\n\n  Types of updates from users\n\n  \n    With replies: In this row, you'll see data related to users who updated their rating or review after receiving a reply to their original review.\n    Without replies: In this row, you'll see data related to users who updated their rating or review without receiving a reply to their original review.\n  \n\n  Data points for your app\n\n  \n    Returning users: Number of users who returned to Google Play to update their original rating or review.\n    Updates to ratings: Upon returning to Google Play, the \"changes to ratings\" section shows whether users increased, decreased, or maintained their original rating.

App ratings don't start over when you publish a new version of your app.\n\n\nAnalyze your reviews\n\nTo help you target the most impactful improvements to your app or game, you can view top trends and issues that users mention in your app's reviews. For tips on analyzing your reviews, visit the Android Developers site.\n\nTo see top trends and issues for your app, open Play Console and go to the Reviews analysis page.\n\nThe following features are available on the web version of Play Console.\nReview summaries: see common themes in your app's reviews\n\n\n  In the \"Review summaries\" section, you'll see the top positive and critical themes that surface regularly in reviews written in English. Summaries update regularly to let you know about the latest user experiences with your app.\n\n  We use machine learning algorithms to create summaries and apply filters to make sure only the most relevant reviews are included.\n\n  \n    For summaries to be available, your app needs to have enough similar reviews around more than one theme or topic.\n    Users may see representative summaries on your app's Google Play store listing in English.\n  \n\nBenchmarks: see how different topics impact your app rating\n\n\n  In the \"Benchmarks\" section, you can see how users review your app in relation to specific categories. This can help you identify and understand trends in your app's reviews. The report analyzes how each topic impacts your overall app rating.\n\n  Any data available within your \"Benchmarks\" section is only visible in Play Console and isn't visible to users.\n\n  You'll see how users rate your app across a series of static categories used to measure all apps in the same Google Play category (for example, Health & Fitness or Lifestyle). The benchmarks report is available for reviews written in English.\n\n  Data points for your app\n\n  At the top right of the \"Benchmarks\" section, you can change the time period for your report. You can also filter results by artifact. When viewing your data, you'll see the following information:\n\n  \n    Common topic: A fixed set of topics relevant to most apps in the same Google Play category. Common topics include the following:\n\n      \n        Design: Reviews that mention the app's visuals (for example, graphics, beautiful game, looks good, etc.).\n        Privacy: Reviews that mention the ability to control information collected.\n        Profile: Reviews that mention the app's sign-up experience (for example, login, can’t logout, sign-up, etc.).\n        Resource usage: Reviews that mention the app's impact on hardware consumption (for example, battery, memory, data, etc.).\n        Speed: Reviews that mention the app speed (for example, lags, slow, fast, etc.).\n        Stability: Reviews that mention app failures (for example, crashes, bugs, freezing, etc.).\n        Uninstalls: Reviews that mention user reasons for uninstalling an app (for example, uninstall, uninstalling, uninstalled).\n        Update: Reviews that mention the latest app version (for example, version, update, etc.).\n        Usability: Reviews that mention how users experience the flow of the app (for example, easy to use, difficult to navigate, user friendly).\n      \n    \n    Average rating: The most negative reviews will be red with a rating of 1. The most positive reviews will be green with a rating of 5.\n    Number of reviews: The number of reviews associated with that topic. The line chart displays the change in volume over the length of time selected.\n    Effect on rating: Any red bars are bringing down your rating, and green bars are improving your rating. The width of the colored bar shows how much that topic impacts your overall rating.\n  \n\n  Peer benchmarks\n\n  In addition to the data for your app, benchmarks show how your app compares to others in the same Google Play category.\n\n  \n    Rating vs. peers: How your rating compares to apps in the same Google Play category. For example, if your app's rating for design is 3.9 with a benchmark difference of +1.2, similar apps have a rating of 2.7.\n    Number vs. peers: How the number of reviews per topic compares to apps in the same Google Play category. For example, if your app has 1,000 reviews for stability with a volume difference of 0.5x, similar apps have an average review volume of 2,000.\n  \n\nUpdated ratings: see how users update ratings and reviews over time\n\n\n  In the \"Updated Ratings\" section, you'll see how users have updated their ratings and reviews over the time period selected.\n\n  Types of updates from users\n\n  \n    With replies: In this row, you'll see data related to users who updated their rating or review after receiving a reply to their original review.\n    Without replies: In this row, you'll see data related to users who updated their rating or review without receiving a reply to their original review.\n  \n\n  Data points for your app\n\n  \n    Returning users: Number of users who returned to Google Play to update their original rating or review.\n    Updates to ratings: Upon returning to Google Play, the \"changes to ratings\" section shows whether users increased, decreased, or maintained their original rating. You can use the colored bars to see how replying to reviews impacts changes to your app's rating.\n      \n        Red: The red section shows the percentage of users who lowered their original rating.\n        Gray: The gray section shows the percentage of users who left their original rating unchanged.\n        Green: The green section shows the percentage of users who increased their original rating.\n      \n    \n    Average rating change: Average change to the app's rating from returning users.\n  \n\n\nReply to reviews\n\nTo reply to reviews from Play Console, make sure you have the \"Reply to reviews\" permission. You can write one public reply for each user review of your app. You can edit your reply to a review at any time.\n\nAfter you reply to a user’s review, they receive a push notification and an email notification.\n\nEmail notifications include the following information:\n\n\n  Name of your app\n  Date of the user's review\n  User's rating and review of your app\n  Your reply\n  Link to contact you by email (using the contact email address listed on your app’s store listing page)\n\n\nFor best practices on engaging with your users through reviews, visit the Android Developers site.\n Using the Play Console website\n\n\n  When you’re replying to a review, you can type your own reply or select a suggested reply, which is a response based on a user’s review. If you choose to use a suggested reply, you can edit it before publishing your response.\n\n  Suggested replies are only available for recent reviews written in English for developers who view Play Console in English. Suggested replies aren’t available for reviews that you’ve already replied to.\n\n  Here’s how to reply to a review:\n\n  \n    Open Play Console and go to the Reviews page (Ratings and reviews > Reviews).\n    In the \"Your reply\" field below a review, type your response or select a suggested reply.\n      \n        If you select a suggested reply and you haven’t added contact information to use in suggested replies before, type a phone number, email address, or website.\n      \n    \n    Select Publish Reply.\n  \n\n  Note: To update your contact information used in suggested replies, visit your Account details page.\n\nUsing the Play Console app\n\n\n  \n    Open the Play Console app .\n    Select an app.\n    Go to the \"Reviews\" section and tap an individual review.\n    Tap Reply and enter your text.\n    To publish your reply, click Send. You can edit your reply if needed.\n  \n\nUsing the Reply to Reviews API\n\n\n  With the Reply to Reviews API, you can retrieve and reply to reviews using third-party services like Zendesk and Conversocial or build your own custom integration.\n\n  As a courtesy to other developers, the Reply to Reviews API enforces several quotas. To request an API quota increase, fill out this form.\n\n  For more information, go to the Google Developers site.\n\n\nComment policies\nDeveloper Comment Posting Policy\n\n\n  The public developer response feature is intended to help you resolve problems with your app and build relationships with users. Your use of Google Play is governed by the Google Play Business and Program Policies.\n\n  Follow these policies when commenting on user reviews:\n\n  \n    Make it clear and relevant: Replies should directly address the user's comment in a clear, valuable, and truthful manner. Try to address the user's comment within the text of your reply.\n    Be nice: These are your users and you want to help them find a resolution, not burn bridges. Do not post content that is abusive, hateful, dismissive, or threatens or harasses others. Also, don't engage inappropriate user comments through replies. Instead, read our posting guidelines for users and learn how to report inappropriate comments. You need to follow our posting policies regardless of the nature of the message you are replying to.\n    Don't solicit or promote: Users don't find solicitations and promotions relevant or useful.\n    Keep it clean: Don't post content that is sexually explicit or contains profanity.\n  \n\n  The use of this feature is a privilege, not a right. Failure to observe the above guidelines and any other Google Play terms may result in a suspension of your application or Google Play developer account as outlined in the Google Play terms.\n\nReport inappropriate reviews and comments\n\n\n  If you see a review or comment that doesn't follow the standards of our comment posting policy, go to report inappropriate reviews.\n\n\nSign up for review notifications\n\nTo receive email notifications when users write new reviews, update existing reviews, or submit new testing feedback, you can set up your notification preferences.\n\nTo learn more about email notifications, see Manage your developer account information.\n\nDownload reports from Google Cloud Storage\n\nYou can access and download reports as CSV files from Google Cloud Storage. Reports are generated daily and accumulated in monthly CSV files.\n\nRelated content\n\n\n  Learn more about Feedback, ratings, and reviews in Play Academy.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nGive feedback about this article\n  \n  \n\nChoose a section to give feedback on\nView and analyze your app's ratings and reviews\nIn Play Console, you can see an overview of your app's ratings, individual user reviews, and clustered data about your app's reviews.\nUsers can rate your app on Google Play with a star rating and review. Users can only rate an app once, but they can update their rating or review at any time.\nTip: If you're a user looking for information on reviews that you've posted, go to the Google Play Help Center.\nRatings delay and pauses\nTo allow us to protect your app on Google Play and automatically detect suspicious ratings and reviews activity, we do not publicly post user reviews immediately, and new ratings do not immediately impact your published rating. Instead, new submissions are generally held back for around 24 hours. You can still see and reply to new reviews, even if they aren’t yet public. This allows you to continue to provide great customer service and quickly address any issues your users may be experiencing.\nIf suspicious activity is detected during the 24-hour delay period, all new ratings and reviews for your app will be held back from being published publicly while we investigate. Once complete, we will unpause and remove any ratings or reviews that were found to be abusive. Notifications and status indicators on the Ratings and Reviews pages will tell you if your app is paused, and the resolution of any investigation. They also show you if each review is public or not.\nBrowse ratings\nView your app's ratings data\nNote: Currently, the rating that users see on Google Play is weighted towards more recent ratings to reflect changes and updates that you make to your app.\nOverview\nAt the top of the page, you’ll see an overview of your app’s ratings, which includes the following:\nCompare ratings to peers\nNear the top of your app’s Ratings page, in the “Ratings vs. peers” card, select Edit peer group to create a custom peer group. After you create a custom peer group, you can see how your app compares with other apps on Google Play that you select.\nOn your app’s Ratings page and on any “Ratings breakdown” card, you can see how your app’s ratings compare with one of the apps in your custom peer group by hovering over any of the app icons displayed on a Ratings vs. peers card.\nPerformance over time\nUnder your app’s rating summary, you can view historical and detailed rating data. You can download the data in any chart you see using the Download CSV button. This allows you to analyze your data offline.\nUse the date-range selector to choose what time period you want your data to cover. This covers a range from the last 28 days, to your app’s whole lifetime.\nUse the period selector to choose how your data is aggregated: daily, every 7 days, or every 28 days.\nAverage rating shows your average rating over each period in your selected date range. You can choose if this average is just for the period (for instance the average rating for a given day), or your rolling lifetime average rating (your average total lifetime rating up to that day). Your peers’ median performance is displayed to help you compare your app’s quality.\nRating distribution shows the number of each rating that you received over each period in your selected date range. Change the selector to \"Percentages\" if you want to evaluate your normalized distribution, as opposed to absolute numbers received.\nRatings breakdown\nSee how many ratings there are, and your average rating, across the following key dimensions:\nSelect Explore on any \"Ratings breakdown\" card to see more information for that dimension, including how your app compares to other apps on Google Play.\nBrowse reviews\nSee reviews for production apps\nSee testing feedback\nIf you have an app in testing, you can access and reply to user feedback in Play Console. Beta feedback from users is only visible to you and can't be seen on Google Play.\nReviews are automatically translated to the language that you use in Play Console. To see a review in its original language, next to a translated review, select Show original review.\nOn each review, you can see the following:\nSome reviews also include the following:\nA history of your replies and any changes a user makes to a review after you reply.

    "content": "Ratings & Review on the Play Store\nOn this page you can find information about ratings and reviews on Google Play, as well Google’s policies for posting reviews.\nYou can write reviews for anything you've purchased or rented from Google Play. Reviews are a great way to help others decide what to get by telling them about your experience. Google doesn't pay anyone to rate or review content on Play, and we expect reviewers to be honest and unbiased.\nHow ratings are calculated\nPlay Store ratings for apps, and the corresponding bar graphs showing the proportional number of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 star reviews, are calculated based on the app's current quality ratings from user reviews, rather than the lifetime average value of user reviews, unless the app has very few ratings. This gives users more insight into the app, and a better understanding of its current state, since apps can change over time, and often add and remove features. We show the total lifetime number of reviews as this provides users with valuable information about the app's use and longevity.\nRatings for other content on the Play Store (books, movies, tv shows) are calculated based on the lifetime average value of user reviews of that content.\nWhat others will see when you leave a review\nMost reviews are visible to everyone, and the Play Store app will indicate whether your review will be public or private.\nPublic reviews will show your name and image from your Google account and past review edits to anyone who uses Play (including developers). Private reviews are usually for apps in early access or beta testing, and only the developer can see your review, including your name and, account image from your Google account, and past edits. For both public and private reviews, developers are also able to see your language, device and country and device information (such as language, model, and OS version). Developers can also reply to reviews and may use this information to reply to you. If you edit a review, other users and developers can still see past edits unless you delete the review.\nRatings and reviews posting policies\nRatings and reviews are meant to be helpful and trustworthy. Reviewing content on Play is a great way to share helpful feedback and assist other Play users in finding great content and services.\nGuidelines for writing a good review\nGoogle Play's policies for ratings and reviews are below. Reviews and comments that are offensive or violate these policies will be removed through a combination of automated and human review, and anyone who repeatedly or egregiously violates them may lose the ability to post on the Play store.\nSpam and fake reviews\nYour reviews should reflect the experience you've had with the content or service you're reviewing.\nOff-topic reviews\nKeep reviews on-topic and relevant to the content, service, or experience you're reviewing.\nAdvertising\nWe want reviews to be useful, and they aren't useful if they're promoting something other than the content or service you're reviewing.\nConflict of interest\nReviews are most valuable when they're genuine and unbiased. They should be written by people who aren't motivated by financial gain.\nCopyrighted content\nReviews should be your own and reflect your personal opinions.\nLearn how to remove copyrighted content\nPersonal and confidential information\nReviews are meant to share experiences, and you can express the way you feel about something without revealing sensitive personal information.\nIllegal content\nYour reviews must comply with the law and any terms or legal agreements you have agreed to.\nSexually explicit content\nGoogle Play is intended for a broad audience, and reviews should reflect that.\nHate speech\nGoogle Play is intended for all people, and reviews should reflect that.\nOffensive reviews\nGoogle Play is meant to entertain and inform, not attack and offend.\nPrivacy\n

You may use Google Play to browse, locate, download, use, rent, or purchase Content. When you download, use, rent, or purchase Content on or using Google Play in the European Economic Area (whether you've paid for that Content or not), you'll enter into a separate contract with Google Commerce Limited.\n\n\n\n\nContent on Google Play\n\nContent you find on Google Play comes from Google itself as well as from third-party providers such as app developers, movie studios, and book and news publishers (“Providers”). These Providers may be either professional or non-professional entities. Providers' content may cease to be offered on Google Play at any time in accordance with the Google Play Terms of Service, for example if we learn that it violates our content policies or runs afoul of applicable laws.\n\nMaking purchases\n\nYou can purchase Content on Google Play using available payment methods that you've added to your Google Account.

To make Google Play as interesting and useful to users as possible, the layout, listing, and ordering of content on Google Play are influenced by the popularity, quality, and relevance of the Content, as well as your prior interactions and purchases with Google Play and other Google services.\n\nGoogle Play may also organize Content into groups based on factors such as app characteristics (e.g. whether an app is a “multiplayer” game), popularity (e.g. “Top Charts” categories), and purchase volume (e.g. “Top Grossing” and “Top Selling” categories).\n\nWhen you're using the search functionality, Google Play tries to return relevant Content by establishing what you're looking for (e.g. a specific app or a category of apps) and returning results that best address your search query.

When you organize apps, many factors are involved, such as:\n\n\n  User relevance: Apps that Google Play tries to show you are those apps that are relevant to your interests and needs. For example, if you look for a game, Google Play will show you games that are popular in your country or region and have good ratings.\n  Quality of the app experience: Apps that Google Play favors are those apps that have a good user experience and are technically sound. For example, apps that crash or have many bugs are less likely to have a higher ranking.\n  Editorial value: Editors at Google Play also hand-pick apps they think are noteworthy and interesting. These apps will feature on Google Play or in the Google Play newsletter.\n  Ads: Some developers choose to pay Google Play to promote their apps. Google Play marks these apps as ads, but they will still show alongside other apps in search results and on other parts of Google Play.\n  User experience: When users browse and download apps, Google Play wants to make sure that the users have a positive experience. For example, Google Play makes it easy to find apps that are compatible with your device and that have reviews by other users.\n\n\nWhen you use the search functionality, Google Play tries to return relevant content by establishing what you're looking for such as a specific app or a category of apps, and give results that best answer your search query.

When ranking search results, Google Play considers whether an app would be relevant to and appropriate for a broad audience.\n\nTo generate app recommendations in a “For You” section, Google Play can show personalized recommendations with information we collect, such as previously installed apps.\n\nAdvertisers pay Google to display advertisements in Google Play. Ads on Google Play will always have a label like \"ads\" or \"sponsored.\" While advertisers can pay to be displayed more prominently in the advertising area, no one can buy better placement in Play’s search results. Moreover, ads will only display if they're relevant to the search terms you enter.

These apps will feature on Google Play or in the Google Play newsletter.\n  Ads: Some developers choose to pay Google Play to promote their apps. Google Play marks these apps as ads, but they will still show alongside other apps in search results and on other parts of Google Play.\n  User experience: When users browse and download apps, Google Play wants to make sure that the users have a positive experience. For example, Google Play makes it easy to find apps that are compatible with your device and that have reviews by other users.\n\n\nWhen you use the search functionality, Google Play tries to return relevant content by establishing what you're looking for such as a specific app or a category of apps, and give results that best answer your search query. The main factors that impact the ranking of search results is the relevance to your search terms, the quality of each in-app experience, and how you engage with each piece of content. When ranking search results, Google Play considers whether an app would be relevant to and appropriate for a broad audience.\n\nTo generate app recommendations in a “For You” section, Google Play can show personalized recommendations with information we collect, such as previously installed apps.\n\nAdvertisers pay Google to display advertisements in Google Play. Ads on Google Play will always have a label like \"ads\" or \"sponsored.\" While advertisers can pay to be displayed more prominently in the advertising area, no one can buy better placement in Play’s search results.

    "content": "Sign in to get personalized Help and resolve your issues quicker.\nUnderstand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety sectionBefore you install an app from Google Play, you can check the app's Data safety section. Developers use the Data safety section to share information about how their app handles your data. This way, you can make more informed decisions about what apps you use.\n\n\n\n\nFor this same video with audio descriptions: Understand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety section.\n\n  Computer Android   More  MoreMore           Find an app’s data safety information\n\n\n  Go to play.google.com.\n  Browse or use the search bar to find an app.\n  Select an app.\n  Under \"Data safety,\" you’ll find a summary of the app’s data safety practices.\n  For more detail, select See details.\n\n\nTip: The info in the Data safety section only applies to apps distributed on Google Play. You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\n\n\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\n\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\n\n\n  Data collection: Developers describe the types of user data their app collects, how they use this data, and whether the collection of this data is optional. Data is generally considered “collected” when the developer uses their app to retrieve data off your device.\n\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"collected\" even if the data technically leaves your device (for example, when the data is only processed ephemerally). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n  Data sharing: Developers describe if their app shares your data with third parties and what types of data are shared. Data is generally considered \"shared\" when it is accessed by the app and transferred to a third party.\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"shared\" even if it's technically transferred to another party (for example, when you give your consent to transfer the data after the app explains how it will use the data, or when the data is shared with a developer’s service provider). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n\n\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\n\n\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nData collection\n\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\n\n\n  An app accesses the data only on your device and it is not sent off your device. For example, if you provide an app permission to access your location, but it only uses that data to provide app functionality on your device and does not send it to its server, it does not need to disclose that data as collected.\n  Your data is sent off the device but only processed ephemerally. This means the developer accesses and uses your data only when it is stored in memory, and retains the data for no longer than necessary to service a specific request. For example, if a weather app sends your location off your device to get the current weather at your location, but the app only uses your location data in memory and does not store the data for longer than necessary to provide the weather.\n  Your data is sent using end-to-end encryption. This means the data is unreadable by anyone other than the sender and recipient. For example, if you send a message to a friend using a messaging app with end-to-end encryption, only you and your friend can read the message.\n\n\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\n\n\n  The app does not access this information, and\n  You provide this information directly to the other service under that service’s privacy policy and terms of service.\n\n\nData sharing\n\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\n\n\n  The data is transferred to a third party based on a specific action that you initiate, where you reasonably expect the data to be shared. For example, when you send an email to or share a document with another person.\n  The data transfer to a third party is prominently disclosed in the app, and the app requests your consent in a way that meets the requirements of Google Play’s User Data policy.\n  The data is transferred to a service provider to process it on the developer’s behalf. For example, a developer may use a service provider to host data on their behalf and in compliance with the developer's instructions, contractual terms, privacy policies, and security standards.\n  The data is transferred for specific legal purposes, such as in response to a government request.\n  The data transferred is fully anonymized so it can no longer be associated with any individual.\n\n\n\nOther information in the Data safety section\nSecurity practices\n\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\n\n\n  Encrypts data that it collects or shares while it’s in transit.\n\n    \n      Some apps are designed to let you transfer your data to another site or service. These apps may declare in their Data safety section that your data is transferred over a secure connection as long as they use best industry standards to safely encrypt your data while it travels between your device and the app’s servers. The sites or services that you choose to have your data transferred to may have different privacy and security practices. Review those practices independently to ensure that you are transferring your data to secure destinations. For example, a messaging app that declares that it encrypts your data in transit may give you an option to send an SMS message through your mobile services provider. You should review the data handling practices of your mobile services provider, as it may not be using encryption in transit to securely send SMS messages over its mobile network.\n    \n  \n  Has been independently reviewed against a global security standard. This independent review validates the app’s security practices against a global standard. The third-party organizations performing the review are doing so on the developers' behalf. This review does not verify the accuracy and completeness of the developer’s Data safety section disclosure.\n  Offers payments through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is an instant money transfer system. It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an RBI-regulated entity. Developers indicate that NPCI has verified and validated this app's implementation of UPI. This security practice is only available for app use in India.\n\n\nData deletion\n\n\n  The Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\n\n  Some apps may offer you the ability to create an account. Apps that offer account creation must:\n\n  \n    Provide users with an in-app path to delete their app accounts and associated data.\n    Provide a web link resource where users can request app account deletion and associated data deletion.\n  \n\n  Some apps that offer account creation may also offer you the option to delete certain app data without deleting your entire account.\n\n  Other apps don’t offer account creation, but may provide a way for you to delete your associated data. To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\n\n  \n    Review the app's privacy policy.\n    Contact the developer.\n  \n  Learn more about Google Play's account deletion requirement for apps.\nOther app and data disclosures\n\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\n\nAccount management\n\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\n\nSystem services\n\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\n\n\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\n\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\n\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\n\nData types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Data type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Location\n      Approximate location\n      \n      Yours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\n      \n    \n    \n      Precise location\n      Yours or your device's physical location within an area less than 3 square kilometers.\n    \n    \n      Personal info\n      Name\n      \n      How you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\n      \n    \n    \n      Email address\n      Your email address.\n    \n    \n      User IDs\n      Identifiers that relate to an identifiable person.

This list includes:\n\n  \n    Data or features required for the app to work, like mobile network access\n    Data the app requests while you use it, like access to your camera\n  \n\n  This list is based on technical information that describes how the developer’s app works. It’s different from the Data safety section, which is based on information declared by app developers about how they collect, share, and handle your data.\n\n  Sometimes, the information in the app permissions list may be different from what's in the Data safety section. Some of the possible reasons for this include:\n\n  \n    The app accesses data to process it on the device, but doesn’t collect or share it.\n    The app collects data in a way that’s not managed by permissions.\n    The service or data type in the permissions list isn’t covered in the Data safety section.\n  \n\nControl app permissions & data collection after download\n\n\n  After you download an app, the app must ask for permission to access certain data. If an app collects data you don’t want to share, you can:\n\n\n  Change your app permissions for a single app or by permission type in your phone's settings.\n  Let your phone automatically remove permissions for unused apps.\n  Delete apps to stop future data collection.\n\n\nTip: If you can’t request that your data be deleted from within the app, you can contact the developer to delete any data collected by the app. Learn how to contact an Android app's developer.\n\n\n\nGoogle Play \"Verified\" badge for apps that handle sensitive user data\n\nImportant: The list of criteria isn’t exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge.\n\nTo highlight developers who are transparent about their security and user privacy practices in the Data safety section, Google Play introduces the \"Verified\" badge. When awarded, the new badge is prominently displayed on the app’s details page and in search results. Currently, this badge is only available for VPN apps. To be considered for the \"Verified\" badge, the app must meet certain criteria:\n\n\n  Follow Play safety and security guidelines.\n  Complete a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation.\n  Publish on Google Play for at least 90 days.\n  Achieve at least 10,000 installs and 250 reviews.\n  Have an Organization developer account type.\n  Meet target API level requirements for Google Play apps.\n  Submit Data safety section declaration, which includes declaring or opting into:\n    \n      Independent security review\n      Encryption in transit\n    \n  \n\n\nRelated resources\n\n\n  How Google helps protect you from harmful apps & malware\n  Change app permissions on your Android phone\n\n\n  \n  \n\nGive feedback about this article\n  \n  \n\nChoose a section to give feedback on                           Need more help?

You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\n\n\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\n\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\n\n\n  Data collection: Developers describe the types of user data their app collects, how they use this data, and whether the collection of this data is optional. Data is generally considered “collected” when the developer uses their app to retrieve data off your device.\n\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"collected\" even if the data technically leaves your device (for example, when the data is only processed ephemerally). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n  Data sharing: Developers describe if their app shares your data with third parties and what types of data are shared. Data is generally considered \"shared\" when it is accessed by the app and transferred to a third party.\n    \n      In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \"shared\" even if it's technically transferred to another party (for example, when you give your consent to transfer the data after the app explains how it will use the data, or when the data is shared with a developer’s service provider). Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n\n\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\n\n\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nData collection\n\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\n\n\n  An app accesses the data only on your device and it is not sent off your device. For example, if you provide an app permission to access your location, but it only uses that data to provide app functionality on your device and does not send it to its server, it does not need to disclose that data as collected.\n  Your data is sent off the device but only processed ephemerally. This means the developer accesses and uses your data only when it is stored in memory, and retains the data for no longer than necessary to service a specific request. For example, if a weather app sends your location off your device to get the current weather at your location, but the app only uses your location data in memory and does not store the data for longer than necessary to provide the weather.\n  Your data is sent using end-to-end encryption. This means the data is unreadable by anyone other than the sender and recipient. For example, if you send a message to a friend using a messaging app with end-to-end encryption, only you and your friend can read the message.\n\n\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\n\n\n  The app does not access this information, and\n  You provide this information directly to the other service under that service’s privacy policy and terms of service.\n\n\nData sharing\n\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\n\n\n  The data is transferred to a third party based on a specific action that you initiate, where you reasonably expect the data to be shared. For example, when you send an email to or share a document with another person.\n  The data transfer to a third party is prominently disclosed in the app, and the app requests your consent in a way that meets the requirements of Google Play’s User Data policy.\n  The data is transferred to a service provider to process it on the developer’s behalf. For example, a developer may use a service provider to host data on their behalf and in compliance with the developer's instructions, contractual terms, privacy policies, and security standards.\n  The data is transferred for specific legal purposes, such as in response to a government request.\n  The data transferred is fully anonymized so it can no longer be associated with any individual.\n\n\n\nOther information in the Data safety section\nSecurity practices\n\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\n\n\n  Encrypts data that it collects or shares while it’s in transit.\n\n    \n      Some apps are designed to let you transfer your data to another site or service. These apps may declare in their Data safety section that your data is transferred over a secure connection as long as they use best industry standards to safely encrypt your data while it travels between your device and the app’s servers. The sites or services that you choose to have your data transferred to may have different privacy and security practices. Review those practices independently to ensure that you are transferring your data to secure destinations. For example, a messaging app that declares that it encrypts your data in transit may give you an option to send an SMS message through your mobile services provider. You should review the data handling practices of your mobile services provider, as it may not be using encryption in transit to securely send SMS messages over its mobile network.\n    \n  \n  Has been independently reviewed against a global security standard. This independent review validates the app’s security practices against a global standard. The third-party organizations performing the review are doing so on the developers' behalf. This review does not verify the accuracy and completeness of the developer’s Data safety section disclosure.\n  Offers payments through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is an instant money transfer system. It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an RBI-regulated entity. Developers indicate that NPCI has verified and validated this app's implementation of UPI. This security practice is only available for app use in India.\n\n\nData deletion\n\n\n  The Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\n\n  Some apps may offer you the ability to create an account. Apps that offer account creation must:\n\n  \n    Provide users with an in-app path to delete their app accounts and associated data.\n    Provide a web link resource where users can request app account deletion and associated data deletion.\n  \n\n  Some apps that offer account creation may also offer you the option to delete certain app data without deleting your entire account.\n\n  Other apps don’t offer account creation, but may provide a way for you to delete your associated data. To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\n\n  \n    Review the app's privacy policy.\n    Contact the developer.\n  \n  Learn more about Google Play's account deletion requirement for apps.\nOther app and data disclosures\n\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\n\nAccount management\n\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\n\nSystem services\n\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\n\n\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\n\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\n\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\n\nData types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Data type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Location\n      Approximate location\n      \n      Yours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\n      \n    \n    \n      Precise location\n      Yours or your device's physical location within an area less than 3 square kilometers.\n    \n    \n      Personal info\n      Name\n      \n      How you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\n      \n    \n    \n      Email address\n      Your email address.\n    \n    \n      User IDs\n      Identifiers that relate to an identifiable person.

This list includes:\n\n  \n    Data or features required for the app to work, like mobile network access\n    Data the app requests while you use it, like access to your camera\n  \n\n  This list is based on technical information that describes how the developer’s app works. It’s different from the Data safety section, which is based on information declared by app developers about how they collect, share, and handle your data.\n\n  Sometimes, the information in the app permissions list may be different from what's in the Data safety section. Some of the possible reasons for this include:\n\n  \n    The app accesses data to process it on the device, but doesn’t collect or share it.\n    The app collects data in a way that’s not managed by permissions.\n    The service or data type in the permissions list isn’t covered in the Data safety section.\n  \n\nControl app permissions & data collection after download\n\n\n  After you download an app, the app must ask for permission to access certain data. If an app collects data you don’t want to share, you can:\n\n\n  Change your app permissions for a single app or by permission type in your phone's settings.\n  Let your phone automatically remove permissions for unused apps.\n  Delete apps to stop future data collection.\n\n\nTip: If you can’t request that your data be deleted from within the app, you can contact the developer to delete any data collected by the app. Learn how to contact an Android app's developer.\n\n\n\nGoogle Play \"Verified\" badge for apps that handle sensitive user data\n\nImportant: The list of criteria isn’t exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge.\n\nTo highlight developers who are transparent about their security and user privacy practices in the Data safety section, Google Play introduces the \"Verified\" badge. When awarded, the new badge is prominently displayed on the app’s details page and in search results. Currently, this badge is only available for VPN apps.

Learn more about these cases below.\n    \n  \n\n\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\n\n\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nData collection\n\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\n\n\n  An app accesses the data only on your device and it is not sent off your device. For example, if you provide an app permission to access your location, but it only uses that data to provide app functionality on your device and does not send it to its server, it does not need to disclose that data as collected.\n  Your data is sent off the device but only processed ephemerally.

This list includes:\n\n  \n    Data or features required for the app to work, like mobile network access\n    Data the app requests while you use it, like access to your camera\n  \n\n  This list is based on technical information that describes how the developer’s app works. It’s different from the Data safety section, which is based on information declared by app developers about how they collect, share, and handle your data.\n\n  Sometimes, the information in the app permissions list may be different from what's in the Data safety section. Some of the possible reasons for this include:\n\n  \n    The app accesses data to process it on the device, but doesn’t collect or share it.\n    The app collects data in a way that’s not managed by permissions.\n    The service or data type in the permissions list isn’t covered in the Data safety section.\n  \n\nControl app permissions & data collection after download\n\n\n  After you download an app, the app must ask for permission to access certain data. If an app collects data you don’t want to share, you can:\n\n\n  Change your app permissions for a single app or by permission type in your phone's settings.\n  Let your phone automatically remove permissions for unused apps.\n  Delete apps to stop future data collection.\n\n\nTip: If you can’t request that your data be deleted from within the app, you can contact the developer to delete any data collected by the app. Learn how to contact an Android app's developer.\n\n\n\nGoogle Play \"Verified\" badge for apps that handle sensitive user data\n\nImportant: The list of criteria isn’t exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge.\n\nTo highlight developers who are transparent about their security and user privacy practices in the Data safety section, Google Play introduces the \"Verified\" badge. When awarded, the new badge is prominently displayed on the app’s details page and in search results. Currently, this badge is only available for VPN apps. To be considered for the \"Verified\" badge, the app must meet certain criteria:\n\n\n  Follow Play safety and security guidelines.\n  Complete a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation.\n  Publish on Google Play for at least 90 days.\n  Achieve at least 10,000 installs and 250 reviews.\n  Have an Organization developer account type.\n  Meet target API level requirements for Google Play apps.\n  Submit Data safety section declaration, which includes declaring or opting into:\n    \n      Independent security review\n      Encryption in transit\n    \n  \n\n\nRelated resources\n\n\n  How Google helps protect you from harmful apps & malware\n  Change app permissions on your Android phone\n\n\n  \n  \n\nGive feedback about this article\n  \n  \n\nChoose a section to give feedback on\nUnderstand app privacy & security practices with Google Play's Data safety section\nBefore you install an app from Google Play, you can check the app's Data safety section. Developers use the Data safety section to share information about how their app handles your data. This way, you can make more informed decisions about what apps you use.\nFind an app’s data safety information\nTip: The info in the Data safety section only applies to apps distributed on Google Play. You’ll only find the Data safety section on Android 5 and up.\nUnderstand & review app data safety practices\nThe Data safety section of an app listing lets developers describe how their apps collect, share, and handle different types of data. Developers explain their practices for:\nDevelopers use Google Play’s Data safety section to describe the sum of their app’s data collection and sharing across all versions of the app distributed on Google Play. An app’s data privacy and security practices may vary based on your use, region, and age. Developers may use the “About this app” section of an app’s Google Play listing, the privacy policy, or other documentation to share app version-specific information with their users.\nUnderstand data collection & data sharing\nDevelopers do not need to disclose data accessed by an app as \"collected\" in the Data safety section if:\nSometimes apps may redirect you to a different service to complete a certain action. For example, an app may direct you to a payment service such as PayPal, Google Pay, or another similar service, to complete a purchase. In these cases, the app developer does not need to declare the data collected by the other service if:\nIn some cases, app developers do not need to declare data that is transferred to others as \"shared\" in the Data safety section. This includes when:\nOther information in the Data safety section\nDevelopers can describe certain security practices they use. This includes if their app:\nThe Data deletion section lets developers describe what ways they provide for you to remove your data in the app.\nSome apps may offer you the ability to create an account.

To learn how to request the deletion of your data and how the developer responds to and handles data deletion requests:\nLearn more about the disclosures for account management data and system services.\nAccount management\nSome apps let you create an account or add info to an account that the developer uses across its services. A developer might use the account data collected through the app for additional purposes across its services that are not specific to the app, such as fraud prevention or advertising. Developers may disclose this collection and use of account data across their services as \"Account management.\" Developers must still declare all purposes for which the app itself uses the data. Review the app’s information, such as their privacy policy, to understand how a developer uses your account data across their services.\nSystem services\nSystem services are pre-installed software on some devices and cannot be uninstalled. They support device-specific features or functions. Developers of qualifying system services are not required to complete a Data safety section. You can review the developer’s site and privacy policy to learn more about their data safety practices.\nTypes of data & collection purposes covered in the Data safety section\nThe Data safety section explains the purpose for collecting and sharing specific types of data. Developers must use the same categories to explain these purposes so you can consistently compare multiple apps. The info should describe all versions and variations of the app.\nLearn more about the data types and purposes included in the Data safety section.\nYours or your device's physical location to an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the city you are in.\nHow you refer to yourself, such as your first or last name, or nickname.\nYour address, such as a mailing or home address.\nInformation about your race or ethnicity.\nInformation about your political or religious beliefs.\nInformation about your sexual orientation.\nAny other personal information such as date of birth, gender identity, veteran status, etc.\nInformation about your financial accounts, such as credit card number.\nInformation about purchases or transactions you have made.\nInformation about your credit.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nPrivacy Checkup\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\nTake the Privacy Checkup\nContents\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\nThings you create or provide to us\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\nGo to Google Account\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in  My Ad Center.\nGo to My Ad Center\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\nGo to Privacy Checkup\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.

Learn more about the companies providing business services in the EU.\nAlgorithm\nA process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.\nApplication data cache\nAn application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.\nBrowser web storage\nBrowser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in \"local storage\" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.\nCookies\nA cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.\nDevice\nA device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.\nGoogle Account\nYou may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.\nIP address\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information.\nNon-personally identifiable information\nThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.\nPersonal information\nThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.\nPixel tag\nA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.\nReferrer URL\nA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.\nSensitive personal information\nThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.\nServer logs\nLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\nA typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:\nUnique identifiers\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.\nAdditional Context\nActivity on Google Services\nIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.\nIn some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.\nYou can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.\nactivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\nWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.\nThis information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.\nYou can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.\nads you’ll find most useful\nFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.\nadvertising and research services on their behalf\nFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.\nAndroid device with Google apps\nAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.\ncustomized search results\nFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.\ndeliver our services\nExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:\ndetect abuse\nWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.\ndevices\nFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.\nensure and improve\nFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.\nensure our services are working as intended\nFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.\nInformation about things near your device\nIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more\nlegal process, or enforceable governmental request\nLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.\nmake improvements\nFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.\nmay link information\nGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more\nour users\nFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.\nWe may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more\npersonalized ads\nYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more\nphone number\nIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more\nPlaces you label like home and work\nYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.\nYou can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.\nprotect against abuse\nFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).\npublicly accessible sources\nFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.\nrely on cookies to function properly\nFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more\nsafety and reliability\nSome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:\nsensitive categories\nWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.\nSensor data from your device\nYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement.

Content may be offered by Google or made available by third-parties not affiliated with Google. Google is not responsible for and does not endorse any Content made available through Google Play that originates from a source other than Google.\nAge Restrictions. In order to use Google Play, you must have a valid Google account (“Google Account”), subject to the following age restrictions. If you are considered a minor in your country, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use Google Play and to accept the Terms. You must comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Content or features on Google Play. Family managers and family members must meet these additional requirements as well.\nThird-Party Fees. You are responsible for any access or data fees incurred from third parties (such as your Internet provider or mobile carrier) in connection with your use and viewing of Content and Google Play.\nUpdates. Google Play, related support libraries, or Content may need to be updated, for example, for bug fixes, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, “Updates”). Such Updates may be necessary in order for you to use Google Play or to access, download, or use Content. By agreeing to these Terms and using Google Play, you agree to receive such Updates automatically. You may be able to manage Updates to certain Content via Settings in Google Play. If it is determined, however, that the Update will fix a critical security vulnerability or critical operability issue related to the Content, or will prevent abuse, the Update may be completed irrespective of your Update settings in Google Play or your Device. If another app store attempts to update Content that was initially downloaded from Google Play, you may receive a warning or such updates may be prevented entirely.\nInformation about You. Google’s Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when using Google Play. Google may need to provide your personal information, such as your name and email address, to Providers for the purposes of processing your transactions or provisioning Content to you. Providers agree to use this information in accordance with their privacy policies.\nIf you are part of a family group on Google Play, your family members in the family group will be able to see certain information about you. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google Play, family members you invite to join the family group will see your name, photo, and e-mail address. If you join a family group as a family member, other family members will be able to see your name, photo, and e-mail address. Your family manager may also see your age and will see a record of all purchases you make using the designated family payment method, including a description of the Content purchased. If Content is available for family sharing and you share it with your family group, then all family members will be able to access the Content and see that you purchased it.\nUnauthorized Access to Accounts. You must keep your account details secure and must not share them with anyone else. You must not collect or harvest any personal data of any user of Google Play or of any user of other Google Services via Google Play, including account names.\nDisabled Accounts. If Google disables access to your account in accordance with the Terms (for example if you violate the Terms), you may be prevented from accessing Google Play, your account details or any files or other Content that is stored with your account. See the Help Center for more information. If you are the family manager of a family on Google Play and Google disables access to your account, your family members may lose access to family features requiring a family group, such as a family payment method, family subscriptions, or Content shared by family members. If you are a family member of a family on Google Play and Google disables your account, your family members will lose access to Content you have shared with them.\nMalware protection. To protect you against malicious third party software, URLs, and other security issues, Google may receive information about your Device’s network connections, potentially harmful URLs, the operating system, and apps installed on your Device through Google Play or from other sources. Google may warn you if it considers an app or URL to be unsafe, or Google may remove or block its installation on your Device if it is known to be harmful to devices, data or users. You can choose to disable some of these protections in the settings on your Device, however, Google may continue to receive information about apps installed through Google Play, and apps installed on your Device from other sources may continue to be analyzed for security issues without sending information to Google.\nAndroid Instant Apps. When you click on a link on your Device, Google Play may check if an applicable instant app exists and, if so, open the link within the instant app. Any code needed to run the portions of the instant app you access will be downloaded to your Device and kept on it temporarily. App details for an instant app can be found in the Google Play store. Android Instant Apps data and settings are synced to devices signed in with your Google account. You can choose to disable Android Instant Apps in the settings on your Device.\nChanges to these Terms.If the Play ToS change, you will be given at least 30 days notice, and the new Play ToS will be effective after such notice period. Your continued use of Google Play following such notice period will indicate your acceptance of the new Play ToS. The new Play ToS will apply to your use of all Content (including Content you have installed or purchased in the past) and all subsequent installs or purchases. If you do not agree with such changes, you will be given the opportunity to download the Content you previously purchased or installed and terminate your use of the Google Play. You may continue to view that copy of the Content on your Devices in accordance with the last version of the Play ToS that you accepted.\n3. Purchases and Payments\nFree Content. Google may allow you to download, view or use Content free of charge on Google Play. Additional limitations may apply to your access and use of certain free Content.\nPurchase of Content. When you buy Content on or using Google Play you will enter into a separate sale contract based on these Terms (as applicable) with the seller which will be either:\n(a) Google Ireland Limited; or\n(b) provider of the Content (the \"Provider\"), including where Google Ireland Limited is acting as an agent for the Provider.\nThe separate sale contract is in addition to these Terms.\nFor sales where Google is acting as an agent for the Provider, the statement, in the Google ToS, that the Google ToS “do not create any third party beneficiary rights”, does not apply to your use of Google Play.\nYour contract for the purchase and use of Content is completed once you receive the email from Google confirming your purchase of that Content, and performance of this contract begins as soon as the purchase is complete.\nPre-orders. When you place a pre-order for Content, your contract for the purchase and use of that item is completed when the Content is made available to you, and you will be charged for the purchase at that time. You can cancel your pre-order at any time up to the point at which the Content becomes available to you. We will need to cancel your pre-order if the Content is withdrawn from sale through Google Play before it is made available and we reserve the right to cancel your order in the event the price changes before your order is fulfilled.\nFamily Payment Method. If you are the family manager of a family group on Google Play, you will be required to set up a valid family payment method for your family members to use to purchase Content on Google Play and within apps. You will be responsible for all of your family members’ purchases of Content using the family payment method. If a family group is deleted, or a family member leaves the family group, you may be charged for pending purchases made by family members using the family payment method.\nGoogle Payments. In order to purchase Content through Google Play, you must have a Google Payments account and agree to the Google Payments Terms of Service.The Google Payments Privacy Notice applies whenever you purchase Content using a Google Payments account. You are responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases made through Google Play on your Google Payments account.\nOther Payment Processing Methods. Google may make available to you various payment processing methods in addition to Google Payments to facilitate the purchase of Content through Google Play. You must abide by any relevant terms and conditions or other legal agreement, whether with Google or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. Google may add or remove payment processing methods at its sole discretion. You are solely responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases you make on Google Play.\nEligibility for Carrier Billing. In order to determine your eligibility to have purchases of Content that you make through your Devices billed to your network provider’s account, when you create a Google Play account on a Device, we will send identifiers of your Device, e.g., subscriber ID and SIM card serial number, to your network provider. To permit this you will need to accept the network provider’s terms of service. The network provider may send us your billing address information. We will hold and use this information in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policies and Google Payments Privacy Notice.\nPricing. Pricing and availability of all Content displayed through Google Play are subject to change at any time prior to purchase.\nTaxes.\"Taxes\" means any duties, customs fees, levies or taxes (other than income tax) associated with the sale of Content, including any related penalties or interest. You are responsible for any Taxes and must pay for Content without any reduction for Taxes. If the seller of Content or Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be charged to you. You must comply with any and all applicable tax laws, including the reporting and payment of any Taxes arising in connection with your use of Google Play or the purchase of Content on or through Google Play. The reporting and payment of any such applicable Taxes are your responsibility.\nAll Sales Final. See Google Play’s Refund Policy for more information about your rights to withdraw, cancel, or return purchases for a refund. Except as expressly set out in the Google ToS, Google Play’s Refund Policy or the refund policies of the Provider, all sales are final, and no returns, replacements or refunds are permitted. If a replacement, return or refund is granted for any transaction, the transaction may be reversed, and you may no longer be able to access the Content that you acquired through that transaction.\nSubscriptions. Subscriptions are automatically charged each billing period (whether weekly, monthly, annually, or another period), and you may be charged no earlier than 24 hours before the beginning of each billing period.\n(a)Trials Periods. When you subscribe to Content for a price, you may receive access to the subscription benefits at no charge for a specified trial period, after which you will be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period. Once you cancel your trial, you will immediately lose access to the Content and any subscription privileges unless otherwise specified. Access to such trial periods may be limited to a certain number of trials for each user during a given period, or other restrictions.\n(b)Cancellations. You may cancel a subscription at any time before the end of the applicable billing period as described in the Help Center, and the cancellation will apply to the next period. For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription, you may cancel that subscription at any time during any month of the subscription, and the subscription will be cancelled at the end of your then-current billing period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period, except as otherwise provided in Google Play’s Refund Policy (for example where Content is defective).\n(c)Reductions for Print Subscribers. Some Providers of periodicals may allow you to purchase a subscription of periodical Content on Google Play at a reduced rate if you are already a print subscriber. If you cancel your print subscription of that periodical or your print subscription expires and you do not renew it, your reduced subscription rate of that Content on Google Play will be cancelled automatically.\n(d)Price Increases. When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, Google will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 30 days' prior notice before the charge is made. If you are given less than 30 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription as described in the Cancellations section of these Terms, and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. Where the Provider increases the price of a subscription and consent is required, Google may cancel your subscription unless you agree to the new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will be charged at the then current subscription rate.\n4. Rights and Restrictions\nLicense to Use Content. After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for Content, you will have the non-exclusive right, solely as expressly permitted in these Terms and associated policies, to store, access, view, use, and display copies of the applicable Content on your Devices or as otherwise authorized for your personal, non-commercial use only. All rights, title and interest in Google Play and Content not expressly granted to you in the Terms are reserved. Your use of apps and games may be governed by the additional terms and conditions of the end user license agreement between you and the Provider.\nViolation of License Terms. If you violate any of the Terms, your rights under this license will immediately terminate, and Google may terminate your access to Google Play, the Content or your Google Account without refund to you.\nRestrictions: You may not:\nThird-Party Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, the third parties who license their Content to Google are intended third party beneficiaries under these Terms solely with respect to the specific provisions of these Terms that directly concern their Content (“Third-Party Provisions”), and solely for the purpose of enabling such third parties to enforce their rights in such Content. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms confers a third-party beneficiary right upon any party, with respect to any provision that falls outside the Third Party Provisions, which includes but is not limited to any provisions or agreements incorporated by reference, or that may be referenced without incorporation, in these Terms.\nPlay Policies. Posting reviews on Google Play is subject to the following policies. If you want to report abuse or other content violations, click here.\nDefective Content. Once Content is available to you through your account, you should check the Content as soon as reasonably possible to ensure that it functions and performs as stated, and notify us or Provider as soon as reasonably possible if you find any errors or defect. See the Google Play Refund Policy for more information.\nRemoval or Unavailability of Content. Subject to the Terms, Content that you purchase or install will be available to you through Google Play for the period selected by you, in the case of a purchase for a rental period, and in other cases as long as Google has the right to make such Content available to you. In certain cases (for example if Google loses the relevant rights, a service or Content is discontinued, there are critical security issues, or there are breaches of applicable terms or the law), Google may remove from your Device or cease providing you with access to certain Content that you have purchased. For Content sold by Google Ireland Limited, you may be given notice of any such removal or cessation, when possible. If you are not able to download a copy of the Content before such removal or cessation, Google may offer you either (a) a replacement of the Content if possible or (b) a full or partial refund of the price of the Content. If Google issues you a refund, the refund shall be your sole remedy.\nMultiple Accounts. If you have multiple Google Accounts with different user names, in some cases you may transfer Content out of an account and into another account, provided you are the owner of each such account and provided Google has enabled a feature of the relevant service allowing such transfers.\nLimits on access on Devices. Google may from time to time place limits on the number of Devices or software applications you may use to access Content. Please visit the Google Play Movies & TV/Google TV Usages Rules for more information about these limits for Google Play Movies & TV/Google TV.\nDangerous Activities. None of the Services or Content are intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, life support systems, emergency communications, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or any other such activities in which case the failure of the Services or Content could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\nGoogle Play Movies & TV/Google TV. For additional details and restrictions regarding your access and use of Google Play Movies & TV/Google TV, see the Google Play Movies & TV/Google TV Usage Rules.\nGoogle\n              \n

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nPrivacy Checkup\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\nTake the Privacy Checkup\nContents\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\nThings you create or provide to us\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\nGo to Google Account\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in  My Ad Center.\nGo to My Ad Center\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\nGo to Privacy Checkup\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\nPrivacy controls\nActivity Controls\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\nGo to Activity Controls\nAd settings\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\nGo to My Ad Center\nAbout you\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\nGo to About You\nShared endorsements\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\nGo to Shared Endorsements\nSites and apps that use Google services\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\nWays to review & update your information\nMy Activity\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\nGo to My Activity\nGoogle Dashboard\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\nGo to Dashboard\nYour personal information\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\nGo to Personal Info\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\nExport your data\nTo delete your information, you can:\nDelete your information\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\nSharing your information\nWhen you share your information\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\nWhen Google shares your information\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\nWith your consent\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\nWith domain administrators\nIf you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:\nFor external processing\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.\nFor legal reasons\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\nKeeping your information secure\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.\nWe work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:\nExporting & deleting your information\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\nExport your data\nTo delete your information, you can:\nDelete your information\nRetaining your information\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\nYou can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\nWe regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.\nData transfers\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\nAbout this policy\nWhen this policy applies\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google LLC and its affiliates, including YouTube, Android, and services offered on third-party sites, such as advertising services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.\nThis Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to:\nChanges to this policy\nWe change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.

Learn more about the companies providing business services in the EU.\nAlgorithm\nA process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.\nApplication data cache\nAn application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.\nBrowser web storage\nBrowser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in \"local storage\" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.\nCookies\nA cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.\nDevice\nA device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.\nGoogle Account\nYou may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.\nIP address\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information.\nNon-personally identifiable information\nThis is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.\nPersonal information\nThis is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.\nPixel tag\nA pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.\nReferrer URL\nA Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.\nSensitive personal information\nThis is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.\nServer logs\nLike most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\nA typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:\nUnique identifiers\nA unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.\nUnique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.\nOn other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.\nAdditional Context\nActivity on Google Services\nIf you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.\nIn some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.\nYou can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity.\nactivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\nWebsites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.\nThis information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.\nYou can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.\nads you’ll find most useful\nFor example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.\nadvertising and research services on their behalf\nFor example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.\nAndroid device with Google apps\nAndroid devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.\ncustomized search results\nFor example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.\ndeliver our services\nExamples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:\ndetect abuse\nWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.\ndevices\nFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.\nensure and improve\nFor example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.\nensure our services are working as intended\nFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.\nInformation about things near your device\nIf you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more\nlegal process, or enforceable governmental request\nLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.\nmake improvements\nFor example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.\nmay link information\nGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more\nour users\nFor example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more.\npartner with Google\nThere are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more\npayment information\nFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.\nWe may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more\npersonalized ads\nYou may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more\nphone number\nIf you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more\nPlaces you label like home and work\nYou might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.\nYou can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account.\nprotect against abuse\nFor example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).\npublicly accessible sources\nFor example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.\nrely on cookies to function properly\nFor example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more\nsafety and reliability\nSome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:\nsensitive categories\nWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.\nSensor data from your device\nYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information.\nservers around the world\nFor example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.\nservices to make and receive calls or send and receive messages\nExamples of these services include:\nshow trends\nWhen lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more\nsimilar information related to your physical or mental health\nspecific Google services\nFor example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.\nspecific partners\nFor example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.

    "content": "\nPrivacy & Terms\n\nPrivacy & Terms\nGoogle Terms of Service\nEffective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\nCountry version: India\nWhat’s covered in these terms\nWe know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.\nThese Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nTerms\nService provider\nGoogle services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:\nGoogle LLCorganized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA1600 Amphitheatre ParkwayMountain View, California 94043USA\nAge requirements\nIf you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\nIf you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.\nContents\nYour relationship with Google\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its affiliates, excluding any local entities based in India. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money.\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\nMany of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.\nDevelop, improve, and update Google services\nWe’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\nOur  service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nDon’t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat’s covered\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat’s not covered\nScope\nRights\nThis license allows Google to:\nPurpose\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\nDuration\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nIf you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\nUsing Google services\nYour Google Account\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\nYou’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\nService-related communications\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\nSome of our services allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\nGoogle content\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.\nSoftware in Google services\nSome of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\nSome of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.\nIn case of problems or disagreements\nBoth the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.\nWarranty\nWe provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.\nDisclaimers\nThe only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the Warranty section; (2) the service-specific additional terms; and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.\nDon’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\nBoth the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms.\nOther than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.\nFor business users and organizations only\nIf you’re a business user or organization:\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\nCalifornia law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.\nTo the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.\nDefinitions\naffiliate\nAn entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, which means Google LLC and its subsidiaries, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Limited, and Google Dialer Inc.\nbusiness user\nAn individual or entity who is not a consumer (see consumer).\nconsumer\nAn individual who uses Google services for personal, non-commercial purposes outside of their trade, business, craft, or profession.

It would be great if we could search transactions by the name or amount of the sender or receiver. This would make it much easier to track specific payments.

The account opening process was smooth and the interface is clean and user-friendly. I liked the quick onboarding and the minimal documentation required. However, KYC image uploading can be improved as it took some time and retries. Also, the number of branches and ATMs is limited.

While the concept is good and the interface is user-friendly, the actual value isn't great. The buy rate for digital gold is much higher than the physical market, and when it comes to selling, the sale rate is surprisingly low. The spread between buy and sell prices is too wide, making it not worth investing in digital gold through this platform. Overall, it's not ideal if you're looking for good returns or value.9 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJar App - Savings & InvestmentsMay 5, 2025Hi Ankur, We are sorry for the inconvenience and we certainly don’t want you to feel this way.

We request you to avail our digital banking services through Onlinesbi.sbi or SBI WhatsApp banking. We recommend to use the YONO Lite app on latest Android version for a secure banking experience.\"\nRabin Sarkarmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMarch 3, 2025As a frustrated user of the SBI YONO Lite App. I'm extremely disappointed with the app's performance. The app doesn't support all devices, which is a major drawback. I've tried using it on multiple devices, but it either crashes or fails to load. The compatibility issues are frustrating, Furthermore, the app often stops working after updating. This is unacceptable, especially when we're forced to use this app for our banking needs. The lack of alternatives makes it even more infuriating.4,405 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newMinor Enhancements\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailfeedback.statebankanywhere@sbi.co.inshieldPrivacy Policy\nApp support\nMore by State Bank of Indiaarrow_forwardYONO SBI: Banking & LifestyleState Bank of India4.1starYono BusinessState Bank of India4.4starYONO SBI UKState Bank of India3.8starSBI QuickState Bank of India3.9starYONO SBI EuropeState Bank of India4.0starBHIM SBI Pay:Retail & BusinessState Bank of India4.1star\nMore by State Bank of India\nSimilar appsarrow_forwardVyom - Union Bank of IndiaUnion Bank of India3.5starSBI Card: Pay Bills & ShopSBI Cards and Payment Services Limited4.6starIDFC FIRST Bank: MobileBankingIDFC FIRST Bank Ltd.4.9starbob World:Banking & ExperienceBank of Baroda4.3starCanara ai1- Mobile Banking AppCANARA BANK4.4starHDFC Bank MobileBanking AppHDFC BANK4.4star\nSimilar apps\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

First impression is, it appears far better. Intuitive design & UI, very easy to operate and navigate.

For example, there is nothing for financial analysis of a stock, no sales/profit and loss figures and no ratio analysis, how much the percentage has gone up in any given time interval.

Their stock and trading recommendations are absolutely pathetic. I trusted their advice more than 10 times, hoping to book profits, but ended up with losses every single time. It's infuriating how unreliable their suggestions are—I've lost so much money because of them. Avoid this app if you're looking for stock recommendations on the platform.

I felt the previous look and feel should have been retained, instead of trying to match that of Zerodha. It is only the interface that I have an issue with, as it was one 'edge' Upstox had, compared to other discount broker apps. Now with that lost, it doesn't really matter which broker you are with.

The Self-Care app really needs major improvements. There's no real-time data usage monitor, no router diagnostics, and no built-in speed test—features that are standard in apps like Airtel Thanks. Also, there's no option to seamlessly upgrade or downgrade FTTH plans through the app. BSNL should consider launching an AI chatbot for support and router optimization, similar to Airtel’s in-app tools. Please update the app to meet current digital standards.

Given the data usage, especially for people with limited data plans or slower internet connections, it can become quite a hassle. It's surprising that an app like this would use so much data without any clear warning or control over it. It definitely affects the overall user experience, making it uncomfortable to browse or shop efficiently.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoVikas Nigammore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 7, 2025It’s better to look for a different application for grocery ordering. Because this application is a very good application only for things you buy regularly on Flipkart, but don’t buy grocery. They don’t deliver groceries properly, even if you call customer service, they will say ‘today or tomorrow we will deliver’, but you will not receive your groceries. If you need to do grocery shopping, it’s better to use a different app. I’ve had a lot of trouble ordering groceries many times.1 person found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newEach year we drop a lot of features that make life easier for everyday Indians.

Highly recommended!Did you find this helpful?YesNoDeepanshu Prakashmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 30, 2025Fraud app... When you do any transaction, they will instantly mail saying that cashback is confirmed and we have to wait for 60-90 days. Later, they cancel the cashback and missed credit cashback after soo many days later that we don't even notice it. Don't ever install. All my transactions were showing up as cancelled. I have followed all the instructions while ordering the product.

Issue is resolved. [It's been ages, I've waited for more than a month, I've done multiple updates but still not able to login in the app. After putting the OTP and clicking the 'Login' button, it shows a 'Cancel' text and the login button get disabled. It's so frustrating. Everytime I had to use browser. App is just a waste.

We will keep working to provide a good user experience.Rohit Shanbhagmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyMay 3, 2024The app started off well, but lately, it has become a nightmare. Unable to login or put attendance on time, causing problems with tracking my attendance. Random logouts and difficulties getting back in. Annoying notification \"its taking too long to log out; so please try again later\" about logging out taking too long. Now logged in, but no clock-in button. Numerous bugs plague the app. Urgently need these issues resolved. Disappointing experience overall.154 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKeka IncSeptember 7, 2023Hi, sorry for the unpleasant experience you had with our app. We request you to upgrade the app to the latest version as we have fixed the bug. Do write to us at support@keka.com if you still face any issue.Falconmore_vert Flag inappropriateSeptember 15, 2022I set up Keka for my business, spoke to the team who were helpful with the setup process and explained the features. I spoke regarding how I want it integrated with the biomemtrics system so it'll be seamless, prior to payment they were very enthusiastic about going forward with it. Once i set up the software various hidden costs started to pop up, to which I understand, but nothing was mentioned when I asked for it initially. Furthermore, a little later they told me it wouldn't be possible.23 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews\nRatings and reviews\nWhat’s newBug fixes and Performance improvements.\nWhat’s new\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailsupport@keka.comshieldPrivacy PolicyAbout the developer Vijaya Yalamanchili  mobilesupport@keka.com  United States  undefined\nApp support\nSimilar appsarrow_forwardPeopleStrongPeopleStrong Technologies Pvt Ltd4.8starLeadSquared CRMLeadSquared4.7starMomentum2.0 Delhi Sarthi-सारथीDelhi Metro Rail Corporation3.2stargreytHR - the one-stop HR AppGreytip Software Pvt Ltd.4.4starSTUCOR - For College StudentsNosda3.6starAssetPlus - MF Partner AppAssetPlus - Mutual Funds4.7star\nSimilar apps\nflagFlag as inappropriate\nGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policy\nPlay Pass\nPlay Points\nGift cards\nRedeem\nRefund policy\nKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharing\nParent Guide\nFamily sharing\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nAbout Google Play\nDevelopers\nGoogle Store"

But the smart speaker and it's service are very pathetic . After 2 months of usage, it is continually going to switch off mode and then switching on automatically. I tried all the trouble shooting methods they provided. But it's not yet resolved. Contacted the person who installed the smart speaker, but he assuredly said there is no problem with the speaker. It's still showing the same problem.

It is very easy to use and payment announcement is on time. You can also settle instant settlement. It's features are great, service is very comfortable. My suggestion is to add other features like NFC tap & pay via card. Overall, it is the best payment app. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.12,735 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoMahesh p Thakaremore_vert Flag inappropriateFebruary 9, 2024If there is a negative marking option this app would have it. I had the speaker not working for over a month and after multiple requests on the app, calls the customer care are least bothered. I finally requested for deleting my account and it took forever. They just don't care.. worst experience ever... Use it as long as you can... If it stops working no one will bother to check.6,670 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoPhonePeFebruary 9, 2024Hi, Mahesh.

Presently, DJB has 58 nos. waste water pumping stations and waste water treatment plants with operational capacity of 607 MGD. Sewerage system has been laid in 130 urban villages, 54 villages and 266 unauthorized colonies in Delhi. The works of providing sewerage facilities in 355 unauthorized colonies are in progress.\n\t40% construction work has been completed for 70 MGD plant at Corronation Pillar.\n\tRehabilitation work on old WWTPs at Kondli & Rithala has been started under YAP-III. At Okhla, a single WWTP of 124 MGD capacity shall be constructed in place of old WWTPs under YAP-III.\n\tDJB has also been actively working in the direction of converting waste into power resource. During last year, power generation at the plants was around 72600 KWH per day.\n\tDJB is actively promoting use of treated effluent to reduce the stress on the demand of potable water supply in the city. Around 89 MGD of treated effluent is already being supplied for non-potable purposes to various agencies such as NDPL, CPWD, PPCL, DDA, CRRI, NDMC, EMDC and South DMC for horticulture and power plants cooling etc. In 2015, a 10 MLD tertiary treatment plant at Okhla was commissioned and treated effluent of good quality is being supplied for washing of DTC buses at Sukhdev Vihar Bus depot.\n\tWhile expanding sewerage network to provide sewerage facilities in unsewered areas of Delhi, the rehabilitation work of 167 Km peripheral sewer lines is in progress and 20% work completed. Also under YAP-III, works for rehabilitation of 21 Kms of trunk sewer lines are in progress. The work of rehabilitation of old and damaged sewer lines shall be carried out through trenchless technology so that inconvenience to the public is minimized.\n\t14 Kms of new sewage pumping mains are being laid in place of old pumping mains under YAP-III.\n\tFor abatement of pollution in river Yamuna, DJB is executing the project of laying of Interceptor Sewers along three major drains of Delhi (Najafgarh, Supplementary & Shahdara). Sewage to the tune of 110 MGD has already being trapped. Present progress of the work is 92% and the project is targeted to be completed by March,2019 in a phased manner. Commissioning of interceptor sewer will trap total of 242 MGD of sewage which is presently flowing into drains.

At Okhla, a single WWTP of 124 MGD capacity shall be constructed in place of old WWTPs under YAP-III.\n\tDJB has also been actively working in the direction of converting waste into power resource. During last year, power generation at the plants was around 72600 KWH per day.\n\tDJB is actively promoting use of treated effluent to reduce the stress on the demand of potable water supply in the city. Around 89 MGD of treated effluent is already being supplied for non-potable purposes to various agencies such as NDPL, CPWD, PPCL, DDA, CRRI, NDMC, EMDC and South DMC for horticulture and power plants cooling etc. In 2015, a 10 MLD tertiary treatment plant at Okhla was commissioned and treated effluent of good quality is being supplied for washing of DTC buses at Sukhdev Vihar Bus depot.\n\tWhile expanding sewerage network to provide sewerage facilities in unsewered areas of Delhi, the rehabilitation work of 167 Km peripheral sewer lines is in progress and 20% work completed. Also under YAP-III, works for rehabilitation of 21 Kms of trunk sewer lines are in progress. The work of rehabilitation of old and damaged sewer lines shall be carried out through trenchless technology so that inconvenience to the public is minimized.\n\t14 Kms of new sewage pumping mains are being laid in place of old pumping mains under YAP-III.\n\tFor abatement of pollution in river Yamuna, DJB is executing the project of laying of Interceptor Sewers along three major drains of Delhi (Najafgarh, Supplementary & Shahdara). Sewage to the tune of 110 MGD has already being trapped. Present progress of the work is 92% and the project is targeted to be completed by March,2019 in a phased manner. Commissioning of interceptor sewer will trap total of 242 MGD of sewage which is presently flowing into drains.

At Okhla, a single WWTP of 124 MGD capacity shall be constructed in place of old WWTPs under YAP-III.\n\tDJB has also been actively working in the direction of converting waste into power resource. During last year, power generation at the plants was around 72600 KWH per day.\n\tDJB is actively promoting use of treated effluent to reduce the stress on the demand of potable water supply in the city. Around 89 MGD of treated effluent is already being supplied for non-potable purposes to various agencies such as NDPL, CPWD, PPCL, DDA, CRRI, NDMC, EMDC and South DMC for horticulture and power plants cooling etc. In 2015, a 10 MLD tertiary treatment plant at Okhla was commissioned and treated effluent of good quality is being supplied for washing of DTC buses at Sukhdev Vihar Bus depot.\n\tWhile expanding sewerage network to provide sewerage facilities in unsewered areas of Delhi, the rehabilitation work of 167 Km peripheral sewer lines is in progress and 20% work completed. Also under YAP-III, works for rehabilitation of 21 Kms of trunk sewer lines are in progress. The work of rehabilitation of old and damaged sewer lines shall be carried out through trenchless technology so that inconvenience to the public is minimized.\n\t14 Kms of new sewage pumping mains are being laid in place of old pumping mains under YAP-III.\n\tFor abatement of pollution in river Yamuna, DJB is executing the project of laying of Interceptor Sewers along three major drains of Delhi (Najafgarh, Supplementary & Shahdara). Sewage to the tune of 110 MGD has already being trapped. Present progress of the work is 92% and the project is targeted to be completed by March,2019 in a phased manner. Commissioning of interceptor sewer will trap total of 242 MGD of sewage which is presently flowing into drains.

Using half a bucket of water and a wash cloth will clean your car better.\n\tCheck household faucets for leaks.\n\tJust think, 15 drips per minute add up to almost 3 gallons of water wasted per day, 65 gallons wasted per month, and 788 gallons wated per year!\n\tChoose new water savine applications like washing machines that save up to 90 litres per load.

New Delhi, the capital of India. Situated on both sides of the Yamuna river, but primarily to the west or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh to the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and was designated as the NCT in 1995. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).  Delhi's city proper population is over 33 million.\n                                Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite  cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida and YEIDA city located in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR) making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).\nWelcome to One Stop Online Solution for Project Monitoring\nPlease use your login ID & password to access the online system.\nDelhi, the capital of India has a strong historical background. It was ruled by some of the most powerful emperors in Indian history.\n\n                            The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. The town was known as Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. In due course eight more cities came alive adjacent to Indraprastha: Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad.\n\n                            Delhi has been a witness to the political turmoil for over five centuries. It was ruled by the Mughals in succession to Khiljis and Tughlaqs.\n\n                            In 1192 the legions of the Afghan warrior Muhammad of Ghori captured the Rajput town, and the Delhi Sultanate was established (1206). The invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1398 put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur, who, after the battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire. The early Mughal emperors favoured Agra as their capital, and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah Jahan built (1638) the walls of Old Delhi.\n\n                            From Hindu Kings to Muslim Sultans, the reins of the city kept shifting from one ruler to another. The soils of the city smell of blood, sacrifices and love for the nation. The old 'Havelis' and edifices from the past stand silent but their silence also speaks volumes for their owners and people who lived here centuries back.\n\n                            In the year 1803 AD, the city came under the British rule. In 1911, British shifted their capital from Calcutta to Delhi. It again became the center of all the governing activities. But, the city has the reputation of over throwing the occupants of its throne. It included the British and the current political parties that have had the honour of leading free India.\n\n                            After independence in 1947, New Delhi was officially declared as the Capital of India."

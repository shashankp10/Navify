But all we really want to understand is the basic effects of quantum theory on our everyday lives, and how innovations in this field are going to shape our future. For starters, let’s explain briefly what quantum technology is.\nQuantum technology relies on harnessing and exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics. What quantum theory does is zooming in on atoms and subatomic particles that comprise the matter. Unlike classical physics which relies on gravity, Newton’s laws of motion and the like, quantum particles have their own rules. Because these particles behave quantumly, we have to mention two fundamental principles explaining such behavior:\n1. Superposition\nSuperposition indicates the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. Even though it sounds a bit crazy, it is similar to Schrödinger’s cat, which can be in multiple states until it is measured.\n\n2. Entanglement\nEntanglement, in terms of quantum theory, is when two atoms are strongly connected, despite being separated by great distances. If the properties of one of them are changed, the entangled counterpart(icle) changes instantaneously, too. This happens even when atoms are placed at opposite ends of the universe.\n\nThese are the two quantum principles responsible for the biggest developments in quantum technology so far. By the standards of everyday physics, these characteristics may seem strange, but quantum physics is not magic. It is being researched under strict rules and principles of mathematics. Some of these quantum systems found their everyday application, and the other ones are paving their way to it. The limits of quantum mechanics are only to be imagined because we are finally learning to control quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\nSome of the technologies we use every day owe their existence to our understanding of quantum physics. Let’s name a few quantum technologies already in use:\n\n\nNuclear power – Quantum theory is needed for understanding nuclear structure. The constituent particles of the nucleus – protons, and neutrons – attract one another strongly by the nuclear forces and their collision creates nuclear energy.\n\n\nAtomic clock – Network time is kept by atomic clocks. They use the electronic transition from one state to another as their ‘pendulum’ to produce an extremely stable and repeatable “tick”.\n\n\nLasers – Today, lasers are the solution for countless problems in science, medicine, and everyday technologies.Their development was based on Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation and later developments in stimulated emission.\n\n\nMagnetic resonance – If you ever had an injury and took the MRI scan, you should know that all of that was possible thanks to the developments in nuclear magnetic resonance and the quantum theory of “spin” angular momentum. \n\n\nSemiconductors – Semiconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. Quantum effects lie on the basis of semiconductivity and solid–state transistors which led to a true electronic revolution and mass production of classical computers.\n\nTelevision – A flat-panel television has what’s known as an LED-backlit display. This uses an energy–efficient light source known as a light–emitting diode. \n\nThe list can go on… But, even though the existing technologies based on quantum physics can be further developed and raise the limits known today, there are certain promises of quantum theory that will transform the world as we know it. Future innovations in quantum field:\n\n\nQuantum computers – The information in ordinary computers takes the form of binary digits (bits) that can only have two states: 0 or 1. The superposition of quantum bits (qubits) allows it to store 0, 1, and a combination of both values simultaneously – using the superpositions of these two states. Quantum computing is currently the hottest topic among investors because this means it has an incredible potential in terms of speed and efficiency compared to classical computers. Nevertheless, there is much work to be done before quantum computers hit the market.\n\n\nCybersecurity – First of all, the entanglement of quantum particles is a great way of improving cybersecurity. Enhancement of tcommunication security with quantum protected cipher keys is possible when entangled atoms are used to detect whether something is interfering with data transmission. Also, calculating the factors of a very (let’s say 500 digits) large number is considered impossible for any classical computer. The very fact that factoring in big numbers is difficult even for the best computers in the world today is the basis for present-day cryptography.\n\n\nQuantum simulators – In 1982, a famous physicist Richard Feynman proposed a simulation of quantum systems. It will allow us to understand the interactions between atoms and molecules. Quantum computers will provide us the opportunity to study quantum physics itself in a way that wasn’t possible before. It may, for example, be used for modeling the drug molecule behavior and for designing novel materials for more efficient batteries or energy… you name it.\n\n\nQuantum teleportation – The transfer of information from one particle to its entangled counterpart is quantum teleportation. The connection between entangled pairs of particles has a minimum amount of entanglement needed to successfully perform quantum teleportation. Researchers have performed many demonstrations of this and by 2017, one research group had teleported a photon from Earth to a satellite orbiting 1400 kilometers overhead. Quantum teleportation is also the center of plans for a quantum internet.\n\n\n \nWhere do you think innovations in quantum mechanics will take us first? There’s still plenty of work to be done before quantum computers go mainstream, but quantum technologies are rocking it’s way to our daily lives often without us even realizing it. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndjela \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent creator\n\nReading about how physicists talk about quantum phenomena can be confusing sometimes.

    "content": "Innovation trends\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat is quantum technology and how it will impact our future?\n\t\t\t\tBy Andjela - 5 min read\nWhat is quantum technology and how it will impact our future?\n\t\t\t\tBy Andjela - 5 min read\nReading about how physicists talk about quantum phenomena can be confusing sometimes. But all we really want to understand is the basic effects of quantum theory on our everyday lives, and how innovations in this field are going to shape our future. For starters, let’s explain briefly what quantum technology is.\nQuantum technology relies on harnessing and exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics. What quantum theory does is zooming in on atoms and subatomic particles that comprise the matter. Unlike classical physics which relies on gravity, Newton’s laws of motion and the like, quantum particles have their own rules. Because these particles behave quantumly, we have to mention two fundamental principles explaining such behavior:\n1. Superposition\nSuperposition indicates the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. Even though it sounds a bit crazy, it is similar to Schrödinger’s cat, which can be in multiple states until it is measured.\n\n2. Entanglement\nEntanglement, in terms of quantum theory, is when two atoms are strongly connected, despite being separated by great distances. If the properties of one of them are changed, the entangled counterpart(icle) changes instantaneously, too. This happens even when atoms are placed at opposite ends of the universe.\n\nThese are the two quantum principles responsible for the biggest developments in quantum technology so far. By the standards of everyday physics, these characteristics may seem strange, but quantum physics is not magic. It is being researched under strict rules and principles of mathematics. Some of these quantum systems found their everyday application, and the other ones are paving their way to it. The limits of quantum mechanics are only to be imagined because we are finally learning to control quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\nSome of the technologies we use every day owe their existence to our understanding of quantum physics. Let’s name a few quantum technologies already in use:\n\n\nNuclear power – Quantum theory is needed for understanding nuclear structure. The constituent particles of the nucleus – protons, and neutrons – attract one another strongly by the nuclear forces and their collision creates nuclear energy.\n\n\nAtomic clock – Network time is kept by atomic clocks. They use the electronic transition from one state to another as their ‘pendulum’ to produce an extremely stable and repeatable “tick”.\n\n\nLasers – Today, lasers are the solution for countless problems in science, medicine, and everyday technologies.Their development was based on Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation and later developments in stimulated emission.\n\n\nMagnetic resonance – If you ever had an injury and took the MRI scan, you should know that all of that was possible thanks to the developments in nuclear magnetic resonance and the quantum theory of “spin” angular momentum. \n\n\nSemiconductors – Semiconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. Quantum effects lie on the basis of semiconductivity and solid–state transistors which led to a true electronic revolution and mass production of classical computers.\n\nTelevision – A flat-panel television has what’s known as an LED-backlit display. This uses an energy–efficient light source known as a light–emitting diode. \n\nThe list can go on… But, even though the existing technologies based on quantum physics can be further developed and raise the limits known today, there are certain promises of quantum theory that will transform the world as we know it. Future innovations in quantum field:\n\n\nQuantum computers – The information in ordinary computers takes the form of binary digits (bits) that can only have two states: 0 or 1. The superposition of quantum bits (qubits) allows it to store 0, 1, and a combination of both values simultaneously – using the superpositions of these two states. Quantum computing is currently the hottest topic among investors because this means it has an incredible potential in terms of speed and efficiency compared to classical computers. Nevertheless, there is much work to be done before quantum computers hit the market.\n\n\nCybersecurity – First of all, the entanglement of quantum particles is a great way of improving cybersecurity. Enhancement of tcommunication security with quantum protected cipher keys is possible when entangled atoms are used to detect whether something is interfering with data transmission. Also, calculating the factors of a very (let’s say 500 digits) large number is considered impossible for any classical computer. The very fact that factoring in big numbers is difficult even for the best computers in the world today is the basis for present-day cryptography.\n\n\nQuantum simulators – In 1982, a famous physicist Richard Feynman proposed a simulation of quantum systems. It will allow us to understand the interactions between atoms and molecules. Quantum computers will provide us the opportunity to study quantum physics itself in a way that wasn’t possible before. It may, for example, be used for modeling the drug molecule behavior and for designing novel materials for more efficient batteries or energy… you name it.\n\n\nQuantum teleportation – The transfer of information from one particle to its entangled counterpart is quantum teleportation. The connection between entangled pairs of particles has a minimum amount of entanglement needed to successfully perform quantum teleportation. Researchers have performed many demonstrations of this and by 2017, one research group had teleported a photon from Earth to a satellite orbiting 1400 kilometers overhead. Quantum teleportation is also the center of plans for a quantum internet.\n\n\n \nWhere do you think innovations in quantum mechanics will take us first? There’s still plenty of work to be done before quantum computers go mainstream, but quantum technologies are rocking it’s way to our daily lives often without us even realizing it. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndjela \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent creator\n\nReading about how physicists talk about quantum phenomena can be confusing sometimes.

    "content": "Innovation trends\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe race to Digital Currency supremacy\n\t\t\t\tBy Deana - 4 min read\nThe race to Digital Currency supremacy\n\t\t\t\tBy Deana - 4 min read\nIt’s no wonder many countries around the world are researching and piloting CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), because they are the next logical step since we are switching many of our daily activities online, and moving from analog cash to digital currency. The way we move and spend money has simply changed and that calls for other changes and innovations. What differs CBDCs from cryptocurrency is that, although it may or may not use blockchain technology, CBDCs are all created and controlled by the government and/or a Central Bank. Which means that they are centralized. Simply put, CBDCs are digital cash issued by the Central Bank.\nIf you can’t beat them, then join them? It’s no surprise that Central Banks are looking into developing their own versions of digital currency – Central Bank Digital Currency or CBDCs. Rise in popularity of crypto currency and development of other payment methods and/or other digital currency of companies such as Alibaba, Facebook and Amazon pose a threat for traditional banking and cash as we know it. The change of consumer behaviour and the preference of using credit card payments and other payment methods and apps that avoid cash also seemed as a pretty solid reason for Central Banks to think more seriously about CBDCs. What seemed as a threat at first could be a great opportunity.\nSpeed, access and efficiency are just some of the benefits. What would usually take up to a few working days and around 6% fee would now be almost instant and possibly fee-free. The efficiency of this payment system would also mean that money could easily be sent and spent abroad in real-time. Businesses would also benefit from these instant payments. \nThe other great thing is that the government could more easily give out aid to those in need, and provide stimulus checks. This financial inclusion means that underprivileged groups without the possibility of using traditional forms of banking would have access and would finally be included in the “virtual economy”. \nThe Central Bank could directly issue CBDCs to citizens, but it could also do this through commercial banks in order to avoid dealing directly with millions of users. Crypto and digital currency is a huge disruptor of the economy, and the government’s ability to implement could possibly get out of hand if they stick to traditional ways. CBDCs would be just an addition, and could easily co-exist with other forms of currency and cash.\nCentral Banks around the world are in different development stages of CBDCs and are seriously taking this into consideration. China being the first to introduce paper money centuries ago is once again the disruptor launching the e-Yuan. Digital wallets are nothing new for its citizens since many are using Alipay and WeChat Pay. But the rise of Tech and Global companies and them becoming major players in the financial system is something any government wants to control. Sweden’s e-Krona is also on its way and would be a great addition for Sweden’s citizens since they already have one of the lowest usage percentages of cash. The e-Naira of Nigeria is also something worth mentioning because the government realized its huge potential and we will probably hear more about it in the future. The e-dollar and e-euro are also something that we could see in use in the near future.\nBut just like any other innovation, this one also has its ups and downs. Surveillance and privacy issues are probably one of the biggest concerns. The government and/or the Central Bank would have real-time insights into your spending and cash flow, information and data you otherwise wouldn’t be giving out using other payment methods and cash. But then again, that is nothing new. We give out large amounts of data all the time almost anytime we go online, so why would this be any different.\nThen we have the cyber warfare threat. How secure would your money be and the information you give out? In such scenarios, entire economies could easily be shut down. Cybersecurity, account and data breach and theft are all major concerns. Of course, there are measures of precaution such as multi-signature wallets and similar 2 Factor Authentication approaches, and we could expect more innovative ways of security. \nAnd since it’s all digital, what would happen in case of a major power outage or a grid going down? The entire system could be paralyzed for the time being. These are all what-ifs, but serious concerns that need to be addressed.\nIt is impossible not to keep up with trends and possibly become the disruptor no matter what your line of business is. Innovations are what fuel the economy and progress. And every once in a while comes a game-changer, something we might fear at the beginning, but after a while, we think how on earth did we ever live without that innovation. Setting new standards and becoming the new norm until some other innovation appears. \nWhat do you think about CBDCs and would you be willing to use them personally and through your business? What kind of payment methods would benefit your business the most and perhaps others as well? If you are thinking about improving your current processes or thinking about developing a new product and/or service, the Innovation Cloud might just be the help you need. Partnering up with the right partner is the job half done! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeana \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent creator\n\nIt’s no wonder many countries around the world are researching and piloting CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), because they are the next logical step since we are switching many of our daily activities online, and moving from analog cash to digital currency.

The e-dollar and e-euro are also something that we could see in use in the near future.\nBut just like any other innovation, this one also has its ups and downs. Surveillance and privacy issues are probably one of the biggest concerns. The government and/or the Central Bank would have real-time insights into your spending and cash flow, information and data you otherwise wouldn’t be giving out using other payment methods and cash. But then again, that is nothing new. We give out large amounts of data all the time almost anytime we go online, so why would this be any different.\nThen we have the cyber warfare threat. How secure would your money be and the information you give out? In such scenarios, entire economies could easily be shut down. Cybersecurity, account and data breach and theft are all major concerns. Of course, there are measures of precaution such as multi-signature wallets and similar 2 Factor Authentication approaches, and we could expect more innovative ways of security.\nAnd since it’s all digital, what would happen in case of a major power outage or a grid going down? The entire system could be paralyzed for the time being. These are all what-ifs, but serious concerns that need to be addressed.\nIt is impossible not to keep up with trends and possibly become the disruptor no matter what your line of business is. Innovations are what fuel the economy and progress. And every once in a while comes a game-changer, something we might fear at the beginning, but after a while, we think how on earth did we ever live without that innovation. Setting new standards and becoming the new norm until some other innovation appears.\nWhat do you think about CBDCs and would you be willing to use them personally and through your business? What kind of payment methods would benefit your business the most and perhaps others as well? If you are thinking about improving your current processes or thinking about developing a new product and/or service, the Innovation Cloud might just be the help you need.

Animals kept in captivity for our own entertainment could finally come to an end thanks to Edge Innovations and their wonderful work of creating an animatronic dolphin, first-of-its-kind.\nDell the dolphin feels and looks like a real dolphin. Designers and marine biologists joint efforts to create these majestic animals and replicate their movement. Medical grade silicone was used to create the skin to mimic their real skin as closely as possible. Although the dolphin is attached to a wire and controlled by an operator, this is just the beginning. A more advanced version is planned in the future, using other innovative technologies such as AI, which will enable the dolphin to swim autonomously without an operator for hours, and that is just one of the improvements.\nThis could be a significant innovation that could put an end to animal cruelty of this kind and animal captivity. Most dolphins kept for commercial purposes are taken away from their families, forced to live in chemically treated, prison-like tanks and pools and forcibly impregnated. For a social and roaming animal such as the dolphin these living conditions are unbearable and have a huge impact on them sociologically and physiologically. The pandemic gave us a preview of how it’s like to live in restrictive/constraining conditions, and no matter how social, or antisocial you might be, living your whole life like a caged animal is unarguably inhumane and depressing. So why do this to other animals?\nThis innovation could transform marine parks and oceanariums, as well as zoos, and at the same time be a more sustainable and cruelty-free experience towards animals. Animatronics could be used for educational, tourism and entertainment purposes. Although one Robo-dolphin cost USD 3-5 million, in the long run, over a 10-year span it could possibly save millions of dollars. A big investment that will pay off and certainly support the mission to stop animal cruelty. \nEdge Innovations has been in charge of Hollywood blockbusters’ animatronic, and you might be familiar with their work in movies such as Free Willy, Deep Blue Sea, The Perfect Storm and so on. But since computer effects have become widely used in filmmaking, this innovative company saw an opportunity in marine parks. And that is just the beginning. This isn’t their first attempt at creating such a dolphin either. Some 20 years ago they built their first free-swimming animatronic and what was so significant is that not only did it look real to humans, but other sea creatures seemed to think that it was real as well. And now, Dell the dolphin is finally transforming an industry that we might have thought was impossible to transform. This actually means that marine worlds and zoos could continue to work but in a much more sustainable, safe and profitable manner. And who would argue that there is something wrong with that?\nAnother great thing about this is that not only does it have the capacity to reinvent industries, but it also gives us the possibility of reimagining our experience with animals and letting our imagination loose. This way we could experience long-lost worlds and distinctive animals. Maybe this innovation will make us appreciate real animals more and give us the opportunity to learn more up-closely about them.\nSustainable innovations are impacting everything around us, and we are hoping they will continue to do so. This is also a great example of how a business can always find another opportunity if it’s open and willing to try something new.

    "content": "Innovation trends\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInnovative trends and technology in beauty and skincare industry\n\t\t\t\tBy Deana - 5 min read\nInnovative trends and technology in beauty and skincare industry\n\t\t\t\tBy Deana - 5 min read\nMirror, mirror, on the wall who’s the most innovative of them all? Although the beauty industry suffered a setback caused by the pandemic and the lockdown, thanks to innovative ideas and the ability to adapt, we are seeing a lot of new products that are more in line with our new lifestyles. This urge for being more conscientious and socially responsible, both by individuals and businesses, gave way to sustainable, clean and organic products, with a technological (advancement) twist. These are some of the leading emerging trends and technologies in the beauty and skincare industry, and even if you are not in the industry, you might get some ideas for your own business. \nProtection over aesthetics\nThe pre pandemic era will differ a lot from the post pandemic era, and we are starting to see that everywhere. The beauty and skincare industry is no different and is flourishing with innovations to support the new mindset and lifestyle choices. Consumers are paying more attention to ingredients, packaging, and ways to protect themselves from pollution as well as stress caused by blue screens.\n\nThe lockdown and remote working have brought quite a few changes to our daily routines. Makeup sales have significantly decreased because of this, but the awareness for skincare has increased even though the air pollution decreased because of less traffic. People started to pay more attention to dirt, bacteria, pollution and above all transfer of Covid19, so skincare and hygienic products became way more important than beauty products. This created a need for better protective beauty products. The SPF is also becoming more important and not only contributed to sun protection products but is becoming a regular addition to other products, both skincare and beauty.\n\n\nThe change in daily routines, our digital engagement and more time being spent in front of blue screens created another issue – eye strain and tech neck, which also created a need for products such as eye illumination supplements, eye creams, and different wrinkle creams. Being safe is becoming more important than just looking pretty.\n\nMinimalism and activism \n \nThe minimalist mentality is starting to kick in as we’ve realised that we don’t need as many products as we used to, and that even our skincare routine can be reduced to a couple of products if not one. Although the beauty industry did suffer a big setback, it is estimated that it will recover by 2027. and be worth over US $463.5 billion. The shift towards a minimalist lifestyle created an opportunity for beauty companies to reinvent their products, and create new ones that have all the main ingredients bottled up in one container. This satisfies the new need, and also answers another big issue of eco-friendliness and sustainability since less packaging is being used. Instead of using a bunch of products in the daily routine, use one product that will do just the job, and be cleaner at the same time.\n\nClean beauty increased by 11% according to NPD, and judging by the looks this is a trend that will become even more popular. Consumers started paying more attention to ingredients and opting for more sustainable products. For the companies, this meant being transparent about ingredients and switching to greener and more sustainable alternatives. Eco-friendly products that use alternative proteins, animal-free collagen and leather substitutes are becoming more desirable. Bhuman powdered hair wash has created a water-activated powder that uses less water than other hair wash products. And we are seeing a lot more sustainable and plant-based packaging across the industry. Being conscientious about the environment is a rising trend that is affecting all industries. \nPersonalization and customization\n\nUnlike regular beauty products you could buy at a store or shop online, some companies have gone a few steps ahead. Know beauty sends you a skincare routine based on a DNA test and lifestyle factors. Based on the predisposition you might have to various skin problems combined with other factors, you get a specific skincare routine designed just for you. When it comes to customer service on another level, Color & Co by L’Oréal, offers a personalized at-home service. This way you can sit down from the comfort of your home, and video chat with a colorist who will give you all the right answers and advice about your color choices. No more regrets and unexpected results from DIY hair coloring endeavors. Another cool product for those who like DIYs and creating custom makeup is GoPlay’s LipsKIT. With their innovative twist on lipstick, you can create almost any color in just a few steps, and with just one kit. Certainly, something to go with our minimalist and activist lifestyle!\n\nInnovative technology and beauty \n\nWhen innovative technologies cross paths with beauty and skincare products, we get some really cool and futuristic products. From robots doing your eyelashes (Luum) to an AI-3D image processing-micro camera - deep learning algorithm-at-home nail printer (Nimble). Science and technology gave a real sci-fi twist on beauty and skincare. When MIT trained-scientists use fluid science to develop a device that hydrates your skin with nano-mist, which contains much smaller particles more easily absorbed, you get Droplette. And when you apply AI technology that analyses your face through an iPhone or cell phone camera, and answer a few questions about your skin type and foundation preferences – you get a perfectly matched foundation by Dcypher. A lot of businesses have had to switch to online selling due to the pandemic, and used this opportunity to boost their e-commerce as well as create a completely new virtual experience with their customers using VR. It not only solved the lockdown problem but strengthened their relationship with the customers and gave it a new dimension. \n\n\nThis just shows that you have plenty of room for innovations and improvement in your business as well. Opportunities for innovations are all around it, and you have plenty of room to improve your existing products or come up with totally different new ones. Don’t be afraid to try some new ideas and see where that will lead your business. A great way to gather ideas and develop them is through our Innovation Cloud Platform that will ensure your business an efficient and successful innovation process. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeana \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent creator\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall who’s the most innovative of them all? Although the beauty industry suffered a setback caused by the pandemic and the lockdown, thanks to innovative ideas and the ability to adapt, we are seeing a lot of new products that are more in line with our new lifestyles. This urge for being more conscientious and socially responsible, both by individuals and businesses, gave way to sustainable, clean and organic products, with a technological (advancement) twist. These are some of the leading emerging trends and technologies in the beauty and skincare industry, and even if you are not in the industry, you might get some ideas for your own business.\nProtection over aesthetics\nThe pre pandemic era will differ a lot from the post pandemic era, and we are starting to see that everywhere. The beauty and skincare industry is no different and is flourishing with innovations to support the new mindset and lifestyle choices. Consumers are paying more attention to ingredients, packaging, and ways to protect themselves from pollution as well as stress caused by blue screens.\nThe lockdown and remote working have brought quite a few changes to our daily routines. Makeup sales have significantly decreased because of this, but the awareness for skincare has increased even though the air pollution decreased because of less traffic. People started to pay more attention to dirt, bacteria, pollution and above all transfer of Covid19, so skincare and hygienic products became way more important than beauty products. This created a need for better protective beauty products. The SPF is also becoming more important and not only contributed to sun protection products but is becoming a regular addition to other products, both skincare and beauty.\nThe change in daily routines, our digital engagement and more time being spent in front of blue screens created another issue – eye strain and tech neck, which also created a need for products such as eye illumination supplements, eye creams, and different wrinkle creams. Being safe is becoming more important than just looking pretty.\nClean beauty increased by 11% according to NPD, and judging by the looks this is a trend that will become even more popular. Consumers started paying more attention to ingredients and opting for more sustainable products. For the companies, this meant being transparent about ingredients and switching to greener and more sustainable alternatives. Eco-friendly products that use alternative proteins, animal-free collagen and leather substitutes are becoming more desirable. Bhuman powdered hair wash has created a water-activated powder that uses less water than other hair wash products. And we are seeing a lot more sustainable and plant-based packaging across the industry. Being conscientious about the environment is a rising trend that is affecting all industries.\n\n\nRelated Articles\nSustainability is entering the crypto market\nAs early as 2023, a large portion of the crypto market will be transformed\nAlgae – agent of sustainability innovation\nAlgae is the Earth’s original energy source!\nWhich innovations to expect in banking and fintech by 2025\nWhat kind of innovation framework is best for this industry?\n1 comments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsafwaan  Moosa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28.03.2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthank you for sharing so much valuable information about skincare and beauty industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLeave a Reply\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tName\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPost Comment \n\t\t\t\t\t\tReset\nthank you for sharing so much valuable information about skincare and beauty industry.\nRecommended reading\nInnovation Cloud\nRue de l’industrie 15, L-8069 Bertrange, Luxembourg\nVAT Number: LU29942327National Number: 2017 2462 988RCSL Number: B219441\nContact us\nEurope, 08-16 CET\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t+352 203 014 87\nUSA and Canada, 08-16 EDT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t+1 (845) 4700226\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice@innovationcloud.com\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContact us\nSupport\n© 2019 Innovation Cloud\nCreate your Innovation Cloud account\nThank you for choosing Innovation Cloud software.\n\nWe prepared for you:\n- Innovation Cloud Startup - completely free idea management software for startups and\nup to 15 users.\n- Innovation Cloud PRO - an advanced idea management software scalable to support\nvarious company sizes.\nNote: Please note that you need to provide an evidence for being startup company during the first 30 days of usage in order to activate free forever license.

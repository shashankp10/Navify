1300+ Road Transport Offices (RTOs) across the country. RTOs issue Registration Certificate (R.C.) & Driving License (D.L.) that are mandatory requirements and are valid across the country, subject to certain provisions and permissions.\nWith wide variations in state policies and manual/ system based procedures being followed across the country, it had become necessary to define same standards for these documents on a pan-India level to ensure interoperability, correctness and timely availability of information. SCOSTA committee setup for this purpose had recommended a uniform standardized software across the country. The Ministry thus entrusted National Informatics Centre (N.I.C.) with the task of standardizing & deploying two softwares - VAHAN for Vehicle Registration and SARATHI for Driving Licenses and of compiling the data with respect to Vehicle Registration and Driving Licenses of all the states in State Register and National Register.The applications VAHAN & SARATHI were conceptualized to capture the functionalities as mandated by Central Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 as well as State motor vehicle Rules with customization in the core product to suit the requirements of 36 States and UTs.\nOur Vision\nTo improve the quality of service delivery to the citizen and the quality of work environment of the RTOs.\nOur Mission\nTo automate all Vehicle Registration and Driving License related activities in transport authorities of country with introduction of smart card technology to handle issues like inter state transport vehicle movement and to create state and national level registers of vehicles/DL information\nOur Objectives\nTo provide :\nBetter services to Transport Department as well as citizen\nQuick implementation of government policies from time to time\nImproved image of Government & Department\nInstant access of Vehicle/DL information to other government departments\nThe latest initiative has been to centralize both these applications for ensuring higher tranparency, security and reliability of operations through a countrywide unified database and provision of a highly citizen and trade centric web enabled environment. The new application being developed would provide for a multi-user environment wherein the end customers (citizens) may be empowered to perform most of the RTO related transactions (including payments) either from the comfort of home or from authorized third party service provider/s in their vicinity. This will also help, to a large extent, in removing the hassles and queues faced by citizens currently (in visiting RTOs for elementary types of transactions),minimizing the extensive paperwork currently being done on the ground and reducing the possibility of middlemen exploiting the uneducated / uninformed citizens. Going forward, mobile based applications would be developed and systems utilizing the Aadhar Based identification would also be integrated with the Unified RTO database for higher security and ease of operations.\nWith steady steps in direction of achievement of its Vision, Mission and objectives , the ministry is progressing towards provision of improved service access to citizens with quality and efficiency in service delivery, transparency in the system and reduced workload for RTO staff.\nThe Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has been facilitating computerization of over 1300+ Road Transport Offices (RTOs) across the country.

Going forward, mobile based applications would be developed and systems utilizing the Aadhar Based identification would also be integrated with the Unified RTO database for higher security and ease of operations.\nWith steady steps in direction of achievement of its Vision, Mission and objectives , the ministry is progressing towards provision of improved service access to citizens with quality and efficiency in service delivery, transparency in the system and reduced workload for RTO staff.\nTerms and Policies\n                        Privacy Policy\n                        Hyperlink Policy\n                        Website Policies\n                        Content Policies\n                        Contingency Plan\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        About\n                        About Us\n                        Sitemap\n                        Terms of Use\n                         MoRTH\n                         CMVR 1989 \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Resources\n                        Fees and User Charges\n                        Act, Rules and Policies\n                        Permit Fees and Period \n                         Manual\n                        Homologation\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Need Help\n                         Contact Us\n                         Frequently Asked Questions\n                         Raise a concern\n                         Calendar\n                       \n                        Web Information Manager\nThis Website belongs to Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH)  Government of India\nDesigned, Developed and Hosted by: NIC, Government of India © 2023.

These services are being started for online checkpost tax payment of vehicles. The owners of these vehicles can access to the portal from any internet access point, and deposit their due taxes through net banking facility. This system will save them the trouble of physically coming to the transport office, while the department will be able to collect their taxes in a cashless and seamless way.\n                                            Once the user logs on to the system and provides the required information about the vehicle, the software calculates and displays the tax amount payable. If the user accepts to make the payment, the portal redirects him to selected bank or treasury site. The user then makes the payment from his bank account through secure Internet Banking. Once the transaction is complete, the software generates a detailed receipt, which can be printed by the user for his records. For checking the authenticity of receipt, the transport department officials will be able to cross-check the payment details by logging on to the portal using this web-based software. They can also view / print various reports which will be generated for officials of the transport department.\nAuthenticated Login\nTax Payment\nPrint Payment Receipt\nCheck Pending Transaction\nCheck Receipt Details\nReverify Failed Transaction"

The purpose of the application was to automate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe RTO operations related to Vehicle Registration, Permit,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTaxation, Enforcement in the whole country. The project has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tachieved a many successes and crossed significant milestones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the past years.\nIn 2009, another major initiative was undertaken to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsolidate the RTO data to State and Central levels in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tform of State Registry (SR) and National Registry (NR)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdatabases through periodic replication mechanism. A number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNational and State level online applications are running on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthese consolidated databases. These include citizen-centric\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapplications, trade-facilitation, payment services and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinformation services apart from enabling data exchange with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of external 3rd party applications.\nIn 2014 a new initiative has been undertaken to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsolidate the whole distributed system into a single entity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the twin objective of achieving proper control, security\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand manageability of the currently distributed systems and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso extending the scope and quality of G-to-C, G-to-B and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tG-to-G services. This will also enable real time access of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfull set of data without need of any partial and periodic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treplication. This application is planned to be rolled out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1st half of 2015.\nThe proposed architecture will consolidate the database\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand applications for all RTOs across all states into a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommon, centralized platform and deliver the core services of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVahan to all the RTOs across the country. The system will be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt on the backbone of a robust data network with adequate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbandwidth and built-in redundancy to facilitate highest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tacceptable standard of speed, information security and fault\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttolerance.

Taking on board different perspectives, including those which may not be ideologically aligned to ours, is especially important for South Africa, as it will confer greater legitimacy to the G20 as an organisation and to the outcomes of the Leaders’ Summit in 2025.The South African government also recognises the significant strides made by the Brazilian G20 Presidency in enhancing the G20 as a site of democratic global engagement. The South African presidency will continue this trajectory.Dialogues with civil society and other non-government institutions will be conducted by engagement groups such as the Business20 (B20), Civil20 (C20), Labour20 (L20), Parliament20 (P20), Science20 (S20), Start-up20 (SU20), Supreme Audit Institutions20 (SAI20), Think-tank20 (T20), Urban20 (U20), Women20 (W20) and Youth20 (Y20), the Oceans20 (O20) and the Judiciary20 (J20).Representatives of G20 Engagement Groups will define joint positions on the group’s agenda topics within their independent dialogue processes, with the responsibility for the opinion-forming processes lying entirely in the hands of these groups.The work undertaken by Engagement Groups will lead to recommendations, which will reach the mid-year Foreign Ministers, the Finance and Central Bank Ministerial Meetings, as well as the Leaders’ Summit.

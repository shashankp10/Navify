There is no conclusive scientific evidence of adverse health \n                                effects due to RF emission from mobile phone towers. WHO has referred to approximately 25,000 \n                                studies, conducted around the world over past 30 years, and based on an in-depth review of scientific \n                                literature, has concluded: “current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences \n                                from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields”.\nWhat are the internationally prescribed standards for mobile tower radiation? What limits have \n                                    been adopted/prescribed in India?\nWHO has recommended that “National authorities should adopt international standards to protect their \n                                citizens against adverse levels of RF fields. They should restrict access to areas where exposure limits \n                                may be exceeded.” WHO has referred to the International Commission on Non-lionizing Radiation Protection \n                                (ICNIRP) which has prescribed the levels limiting EMF emission from Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) as \n                                safe for general public. DoT has adopted the radiation limits prescribed by ICNIRP and instructions have \n                                been issued to all the telecom service providers. The limits adopted by DoT have been made 10 times more \n                                stringent than the limit prescribed by ICNIRP. Keeping the precautionary EMF safe exposure limits for the \n                                Radio Frequency Field (Base Station Emissions) as 1/10th of the safe limits prescribed by ICNIRP for all \n                                areas in India, eliminates the need for fixing lower limits for specific localities like schools, hospitals, \n                                residential premises, children playgrounds; a segregation of which is impractical in densely populated \n                                localities.\nFor more information, please click this link.\nCaution for installation of mobile towers:-\nFor more information, please click this link.\nCyber Awareness, Reporting and Cyber Swachhta Kendra\nInternational calls with Indian number\nTRAI MySpeed\nTRAI Analytics portal hosts various features for telecom subscribers as detailed below:-\nRedirecting to external link\nYou are being redirected to an external website.

However after sending a mail, I received a call and I was asked to send more details like my phone version, screenshot of the error message etc. However as I tried again the site got registered and I have submitted my complaint. so far so good waiting for my problem to be solved about recieving spam call. Till then I think it is a good initiative by our government.18 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoDepartment of Telecommunications, Govt of IndiaMarch 25, 2025Dear User, Thank you for providing your rating. We’re glad to hear that the issue was resolved. Sometimes, due to network issues, SMS registration may be delayed and we appreciate your patience. Your feedback motivates us to keep improving every day. Thank you for using Sanchar Saathi!Milind Ranemore_vert Flag inappropriateMarch 20, 2025it was working fine till recived update today. made it difficult to log a complaint. e.g. in case of spam sms, you have made sender mobile number mandatory which is not available in case of chatbox. also if you switch to other app and come back, screen gets lots of junk characters making it unreadable. never faced these issues with earlier release.118 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoDepartment of Telecommunications, Govt of IndiaMarch 21, 2025Dear User,\nApologies for the inconvenience.

  Complaint/report against UCC\nComplain or report against UCC:\nIf you think the message or call received is UCC or spam, you can complain or report it to your Telecom Service Provider (TSP).\nThis won't stop all messages but it may allow TSP to take action.\nThere is a difference between making a complaint and reporting UCC or spam.\n\nDifference between making a complaint and reporting UCC or spam:\nAny complaint made within 3 days from the date of UCC/Spam are considered valid complaints. These complaints are entitled for further investigation and may lead to action against senders. Ex. You receive UCC/Spam on 15/04/2021 so you must complain before 18/04/2021. \nBut complaints made beyond 3 days are considered Reports. These reports would not lead to action against the sender at first hand but would aid in finding such spammers proactively. \n\nMake a complaint or report about UCC or spam:\nWhen you make a complaint, TSP will ask you for:\n\n● Mode of communication\n● Details of sender\n● Date and Time of message or call\n● Category of commercial communication\n● Description of message or call\n\n\nAfter you make a complaint or report:\nYour TSP will share a complaint ID through which you can track your complaint or report and actions taken against it.\n\nModes to register complaint or report:\n\n● sending SMS to short code 1909; or\n● calling on 1909; or\n● Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS); or\n● Mobile app developed in this regard either by the Authority or by any other person or entity and approved by the Authority; or\n● Web portal with authentication through One Time Password (OTP); or\n● Any other means as may be notified by the Authority from time to time\n\n\nWhen you report UCC or spam, TSP does not register this as a complaint. It is a quick way to give TSPs information about UCC or spam activity so they can identify spam trends and potential compliance issues.\n\nCode of Practice - Complaint handling:\nCode of practice for Complaint (COP-Complaint) to be developed by TSPs with reference to Schedule -III of TCCCPR, 2018.\nEvery TSP is required to comply with the submitted COPs, provided that any provision in Code(s) of Practice shall not have effect to the extent of being inconsistent with the regulations.\n\nLinks of TSPs' websites for COP-Complaint\n\nFind out who sent you the SMS:\nThe Header Information Portal facilitates Customers to know the sender of Commercial and Government awareness communications. This portal may also help other principal entities to check whether any look-alike header is registered by any other entity. Anyone can query a particular header or download the complete list. TSPs can upload the list of alpha-numeric headers assigned to Principal Entities (Business or legal entities).\nHeader Information Portal link\nComplain or report against UCC:\nIf you think the message or call received is UCC or spam, you can complain or report it to your Telecom Service Provider (TSP).\nThis won't stop all messages but it may allow TSP to take action.\nThere is a difference between making a complaint and reporting UCC or spam.\nDifference between making a complaint and reporting UCC or spam:\nAny complaint made within 3 days from the date of UCC/Spam are considered valid complaints.
